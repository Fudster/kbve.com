There are multiple areas within the `deadcode` but the objective would be to help understand, learn and grow from the vast amount of old code.  \n\n## History\n\nWe want to keep an archive of old / deprecated software scripts/libraries as a reference material for future programmers, hackers and researchers. As more and more codebases are fading out or being replaced, it might be wise to keep records of important functions and modules as an educational source of information.\n","collection":"theory","data":{"title":"DeadCode","description":"DeadCode is a theory that focuses on learning from archived code.","tags":["deadcode","theory"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1476370648495-3533f64427a2?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}},{"id":"fintech.md","slug":"fintech","body":"\n\n## Information\n\nFinTech, Financial Technology, is an economical construct that stems from classical capitalism and the expansion of informatics through the information age.\n\n## FinTech A-Z\n\nWe decided to write out the `A, B, C, D, s` of the fintech universe into cute and informative reference notes, making it easier for newcomers to understand!\n\n## A\n\n> The *A* in FinTech stands for *Artificial Intelligence*.\n> We have extensive notes on this area within our [ML/AI](https://kbve.com/application/ml/) page\n\n## B\n\n> The *B* in FinTech stands for *Blockchain*.\n> We still need to expand these notes for our favorite data storage mechanism.\n\n## C\n\n> The *C* in FinTech stands for *Cloud Computing*.\n> We could dive into the types of cloud(s), building your own, expanding it via k8s/docker, ect..\n\n## D\n\n> The *D* in FinTechAZ stands for *Data*.\n> A great analogy would be the idea that data mining / collection is equivalent to crude oil, while data organization is equivalent to chemical refinement.\n> Data comes as a cluster of random hydrocarbons and the (data organization) is the separation of the data types, variables and data meta-info.\n\n## E\n\n> The *E* in FinTechAZ stands for *Energy*.\n> The electrical costs from a sustainability aspect to an overall cost reduction within the given environment.\n\n## F\n\n> The *F* is *Financial*.\n\n## G\n\n> The *G* is *Gamification*.\n\n## H\n\n> The *H* is *Hedge*.\n\n## I\n\n> The *I* is: *Internet of Things*\n\n## J\n\n> The *J* is: *Jurisdiction*.\n\n## K\n\n> The *K* is: *Key Kilobyte*.\n> I am definitely trying to sneak {K} into the mix xD.\n> The `key` aspect is important from data relations to cryptography.\n\n## L\n\n> The *L* is: *Leverage Lion*.\n\n## M\n\n> The *M* is: *Macro Monkey*.\n\n## N\n\n> The *N* is: *NAV Net*.\n> NAV\n\n## O\n\n> The *O* is: *Operations Octopus*.\n\n## P\n\n> The *P* is *Profit Prophet*.\n\n## Q\n\n> The *Q* is *Qualitative*.\n\n## R\n\n> The *R* is *Real Estate*.\n\n## S\n\n> The *S* is Security.\n> This includes the representation of negotiable financial instruments AND realms of cybersecurity.\n\n## T\n\n> The *T* is for *Technology*.\n\n## U\n\n> The *U* is for *Utility*.\n\n## V\n\n> The *V* is for *Virtual*.\n\n## W\n\n> The *W* is for *Wealth*.\n> The *Wealth* is a representation of capital within a personal/corporate entity through the form of credit, debt and futures.\n\n## X\n\n> The *X* is for *Xenon*.\n> Xenocurrency is a term to define currencies that are deposited/exchanged in markets outside of its origin.\n\n## Y\n\n> The *Y* is for *Yield*.\n\n## Z\n\n> The *Z* is for *Zombie*.\n\n## References\n\nThese are the notes / references that we used to compile the foundation of the `A-Z` glossary.\nSome of these information sheets may be removed/replaced with more specific documentation references, as the l\n\n```text\n\nhttps://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/11ea23266a1f65d9a08cbe0e9b072c89-0430012022/original/Fintech-and-the-Future-of-Finance-Glossary.pdf\n\n```\n\n## Art\n\nThe artwork for the AZ will be made using a combination of Stable Diffusion with Artful Intelligence v1.

It has been expanded upon through various periods of time and still continues to be improved.\n\n## Eisenhower Matrix\n\n- The theory places all objectives through a simple quadrant based upon the priority.\n\n- We have added onto the existing Eisenhower Matrix system, such that we also have a simple priority\nnumbering system on top of it. The system is as follows:\n  - Urgent & Important: This is set in Github Projects as \"1 U-I\"\n  - Urgent & Not Important: This is set as \"2 U-NI\"\n  - Not Urgent & Important: This is set as \"3 NU-I\"\n  - Not Urgent & Not Important: This is set as \"4 NU-NI\"\n\n- Then in the labels for the issues, we've added a numbering system that starts at zero (lowest priority) and can scale infinitely, with higher numbers being higher priority. For now, we have just 0 through 3, designated as Low, Medium, High, and Very High Priority.\n- With this, in Github Projects, we can group by the Eisenhower Matrix, and then sort by labels.\n- If the priority labels start with the number, then they'll be sorted by those priorities. Order by Z-A (Descending) and you'll have the highest priority tasks at the top of each grouped list for every quadrant of the Eisenhower matrix.\n\n## State\n\n- The Change Control Flow proceeds:\n  - -> Preserve the [Present State]\n  - -> Plan the [Future State]\n  - -> Review* and Approve the {Change}\n  - -> Build the {Change}\n  - -> Launch the {Change}  \n- [Present State] becomes [Preserved State], [Future State] becomes [Present State]\n\n* * *\n\n## Terms\n\n- Launch: (alias of `submit`, `execute`, `Go-Live...`) the execution of the state.\n- Build: (alias of `develop`, `Code`, `Work On...`) the development of the state.\n- Review: Depending on the domain of the system being changed, different people should be contacted to be made aware of the impending change. Some people, managers, are empowered to approve or deny a change.\n- Preserve: When a Change is being considered, the first action is always to \"Save your Work\", and capture certain or all elements of the Present and current State of the system that is impact.\n- Plan: The set of instructions that further define and detail the Change to come. The Plan represents a wide variety of types of documentation. The Plan can be adjusted several times while being prepared to be approved.\n\n## Notes\n\n## Journal\n\n``` { #journal }\n9/22/2022\n> Ziggy had some ideas\n  - Rather than using a simple quadrant system, we could extend the matrix to include a positive and negative array between -100 and 100 in order to 'map out' each task in a much more thorough way.\n  - This could then be used as part of a ai assistant with a simple question to the user\n\n  3rd dimension: Z\n  - Priority range of -10 to 10\n```\n\n## References\n\n1.

Is lightly expanding on titles or being more specific with each title, this way when whoever needs to do that task already knows exactly what it is, so its the same picture in everyone's head, leading to a lot less confusion and potentially preventing the situation of whomever is working on the task making something completely different than what it was supposed to be\n>Jab5: the other thing id more or less think about is potentially setting specific times/lengths on different tasks, as that helps to make sure that things more or less do get done in the first place. This largely subjective because it depends a lot on how your group works on it for example if its just every once in a while then that probably wont be very helpful. But having an understanding of the time frame on the individual tasks is something that will always potentially be useful\n>Jab5: And just remember the tool is only as good as your team uses it. So if its just one person interacting with it then honestly going into a large large amount of detail may potentially be more trouble than its worth\n>Jab5: but thats just what i got from looking at how its all arranged from the outside. Its all honestly completely subjective to how it works best for the team itself\n","collection":"theory","data":{"title":"Matrix","description":"KBVE Matrix is based upon the Eisenhower Matrix and git.","tags":["concept","management","task"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606606767399-01e271823a2e?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}},{"id":"programming.md","slug":"programming","body":"\n## Free Programming Books\n\n- Collection of [Free Programming Books](https://ebookfoundation.github.io/free-programming-books/)\n","collection":"theory","data":{"title":"Programming","description":"Programming Notes and Resources","tags":["programming","theory","resources"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1476370648495-3533f64427a2?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}}]
