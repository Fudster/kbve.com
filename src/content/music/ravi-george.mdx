## Information

This article is currently in draft, as I am sourcing material to reference.
The premise will be to look at the abstract influence that this unique west and east cultural friendship produced.

[Vintage footage of George and Ravi](https://youtu.be/mwb3tHWQJEY?t=2566) , thought it was a great throwback!
I will try to include various pieces of unique content that I find directly inside of the article.
