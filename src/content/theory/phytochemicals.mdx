## Information

Phytochemicals are a broad and complex group of chemical compounds produced by plants.

### Polyphenols

Polyphenols are a group of natural compounds that have a common feature: they have several hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings, which are carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal shape. 
Polyphenols can be classified into four main types, depending on their structure and origin, and these types are phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, and lignans. 
Remember that polyphenols are not a well-defined group of compounds, but they share some chemical and biological properties that make them interesting for health and nutrition.

#### Phenolic Acids
Phenolic acids are derived from benzoic or cinnamic acid and are found in fruits, vegetables, cereals, and spices. 

#### Flavonoids
Flavonoids are the most abundant and diverse polyphenols and are found in almost all plants. 

#### Stilbenes

They have a basic structure of two aromatic rings connected by a three-carbon chain. 
Stilbenes are rare polyphenols that have a structure of two aromatic rings linked by a double bond. 
They are found in grapes, peanuts, and berries. 

#### Lignans

Lignans are polyphenols that have a structure of two phenylpropane units connected by a carbon-carbon bond. 
They are found in seeds, grains, and legumes.
