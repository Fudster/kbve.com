# Art

The artwork for the AZ will be made using a combination of Stable Diffusion with Artful Intelligence v1. We can start with breaking down the outline of all 26 letters, then expand their term to at least 3-5 sentences, which we will then feed into the machine to output a visual art piece for the respected letter. The style would be a mixture of classic 90s cartoons mixed with old school anime but we will test case out a couple and see where it goes from there.
