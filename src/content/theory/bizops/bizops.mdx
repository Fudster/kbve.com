## Business Operations

This document will go over the basics on business operations, following this basic bullet point list below:

- Create a holding company that has nothing to do with me personally (e.g. Magic 8 Ball Holding)
- Since it is a holding company, it can only own shares
- Then make the LLC for whatever I'm trynna do, owned by the holding company
- The more nested the holding companies are, the better
- The purpose for this is to remove liability and add extra steps just in case

## Structure

The way that you setup the company makes a difference when it comes to taxes, liability, ethics and several other factors.
These are the two current structures that we alluded to during one of our meetings, but we can expand upon them and add more later down.
