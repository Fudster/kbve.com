## Information

If you have a website, you probably want to make sure that it is visible and performing well on search engines like Google and Bing.
But how do you know if your site is indexed, optimized, and free of errors?
That’s where the amazing KBVE webmaster tool comes in.
Our webmaster tool is a collection of free services offered by search engines that allow you to monitor and maintain your site’s presence and performance.
They also help you identify and fix any issues that might affect your site’s ranking or user experience.

## Tool

The Webmaster Tool : Embed will be placed before these notes? We might be re-design the slot system within the MDX to include tools.

## Notes

These are the official notes for the `webmaster` MDX reference document.
The current list of services that we will be supporting will be included in this notes page.

Button List:

- Google Webmaster Search , located here -> `https://search.google.com/search-console?utm_source=about-page&resource_id=sc-domain:kbve.com`. 
The trailing domain `kbve.com` will be swapped out with the domain that the user wants to run the tool on.

- Ahrefs, located here -> `https://app.ahrefs.com/v2-site-explorer/overview?mode=subdomains&target=kbve.com%2F`. 
Same concept, we will just swap out the `kbve.com` with the domain variable when rendering the buttons

- Majestic , located here -> `https://majestic.com/reports/site-explorer?IndexDataSource=F&oq=kbve.com&q=`
 

KBVE Specific:

There are two smaller modules that we are in the blueprint stage for. 
Both of the tools are being design to make certain aspects of SEO / SEM a bit more automated. 
Mod A will be specific with finding errors within the current main domain / page. 
Mod B will focus on generating suggestions to help improve the rank of the page.

Got the basics of the tool up and running! I will come back to update the document with private cloud function scopes with the next update.
Currently the tool does not communicate with our backend API.

Started to write the JSX file for the webmaster tool.
Under the blueprint, I will test it out here through AstroJS and then later on migrate it into its own repo.
`widget-tool-webmaster` ? And then have the tools page just pull the bundled javascript file and run it.

Added tabs to the webmaster tool. Testing the private script.

- 2023-04-11

Added the details widget and will start to expand upon the notes, with the goal of launching our first webmaster tool within the end of Q2.
Also added a task list under the log, to make it easier.

It looks like we have better mdx support with AstroJS v2, I think I might try a bring the webmaster tool online via this page.
Dev Notes for launch.
Major issue with MDX files on the render and dev side.
Currently, it seems that mdx files are causing a decent amount of issues for us within the `Content` System/API.
I am going to use this as a test case for the mdx problems, hopefully I could find a patchwork solution until the next major release for AstroJS. 
I did reach out to the team but it seems that they are on holiday break but they are aware of the issues and have stated that this is an experimental area.
