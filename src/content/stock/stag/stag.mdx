## Information

STAG Industrial Inc. a.k.a $STAG, is a real estate investment trust (#REIT) that specializes in acquiring, owning, and operating industrial properties across the United States. 
This means that $STAG invests in properties such as warehouses, distribution centers, and light manufacturing facilities. 
STAG’s focus on industrial properties has allowed it to become a leader in the industrial real estate market with a robust portfolio of strategically located assets.
