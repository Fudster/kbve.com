title: Portainer Traefik Swarm
description: |
    Portainer and Traefik are pivotal tools in the Docker ecosystem that enhance container management and routing in Docker Swarm environments.
    Portainer provides a user-friendly web interface, making it easier for developers and administrators to manage containers, networks, and volumes in Swarm clusters.
    On the other hand, Traefik acts as a dynamic reverse proxy, automatically detecting and routing traffic to services as they're scaled or deployed. 
    Together, these tools simplify and automate the orchestration and scaling of containerized applications within Docker Swarm.

This section of the document is focused on getting Portainer running behind a Traefik reverse proxy inside of a Docker swarm!

#### Portainer Traefik Stack

This is currently the stack that we have deployed in our eco-system! ETA: 1 Week before I release it, need to fix up some issues with the cloudflare proxy.
