The plan is to document the setup and journey of getting pocket base up and running!
Right now I am looking at the development side, including making sure that the database can be backed up.
One of my other concerns would be the security of the data and the files, what if someone uploads a bad item, like a shell script!
Or even worse, what happens if a backup does not recover automatically!
