## Information

> TLDR; Flutter is an open source cross platform development kit.

Flutter is a software development kit created by Google that allows developers to build beautiful and natively compiled applications for almost any platform - mobile (Android and iOS), web (any browser) and desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) all from a single codebase. 
Flutter is often used with DART, which is an object-oriented programming language by Google. 
The biggest advantage of flutter is that it can be used to create cross-platform applications. 
So, if you want to build an app that looks stunning and works great on any device, Flutter is the way to go! ðŸ˜Š

## Packages

[Pub.dev](https://pub.dev) is the official package repository for Dart / Flutter apps! However we will show you how to add your own custom packages as well.

### Markdown

We have two packages that we are currently looking into for markdown / md files, however we were not able to find a solution yet to render full MDX / Markdown Javascript.
