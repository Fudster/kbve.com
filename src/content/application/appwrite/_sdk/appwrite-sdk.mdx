## SDK


```javascript
const sdk = require('node-appwrite'); 
```

Then to call it from inside the `module.exports` if you want to use it as a function.

```javascript
const client = new sdk.Client();

let account = new sdk.Account(client);
let avatars = new sdk.Avatars(client);
let database = new sdk.Database(client);
let functions = new sdk.Functions(client);
let health = new sdk.Health(client);
let locale = new sdk.Locale(client);
let storage = new sdk.Storage(client);
let teams = new sdk.Teams(client);
let users = new sdk.Users(client);
```
