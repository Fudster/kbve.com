## Functions

General documentation and information in reference to the cloud functions / open runtime for Appwrite.

### Default Variables

List of the common and default variables when deploying the cloud function, I am thinking of making them all inside of a `kbve.js` file, that we could then reference within our scripts.

#### SDK

```javascript
const sdk = require('node-appwrite'); // Import outside of the module function.
```

Then to call it from inside the `module.exports`

```javascript
const client = new sdk.Client();

let account = new sdk.Account(client);
let avatars = new sdk.Avatars(client);
let database = new sdk.Database(client);
let functions = new sdk.Functions(client);
let health = new sdk.Health(client);
let locale = new sdk.Locale(client);
let storage = new sdk.Storage(client);
let teams = new sdk.Teams(client);
let users = new sdk.Users(client);
```

The main `module.exports` is usually written like this

```javascript
module.exports = async function (req, res) {}; // Passing req and res
```

The `req` contains these three main objects:

`req.headers` - An object with the request headers for the function.
`req.payload` - An object with the payload, which is the main body data.
`req.env` - An object with the environment data.

The `res` can return two main objects:

`res.send` - returns a `text` and `statusCode`.
`res.json` - returns an `object` and `statusCode`.

Example of parsing the `req.payload` check and `res.json` return.

```javascript
if (req.payload) {
	try {
		payload = JSON.parse(req.payload);
	} catch (error) {
		errorHandler('Corrupt payload for the function.');
	}
} else {
	errorHandler('Missing payload for the function.');
}
```

In this case our `errorHandler` function would be:

```javascript
const errorHandler = (__errorMessage, statusCode = 418) => {
	res.json({ data: 'error', message: __errorMessage }, statusCode);
};
```
