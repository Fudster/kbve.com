### GPT
  - GPT , currently known as GPT-3, stands for `Generative Pre-trained Transformer` with the number representing the generation via version control and is a neural network machine learning model

  - #### GPT-Neo
    - Official Github [Repo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo)
      - We should note that the team, EleutherAI, are no longer maintaining the `gpt-neo` and their repo is currently in archive mode. However below is the `gpt-neox`, which is still being actively maintained as for Oct 2022.
    - The `GPT-Neo` may have been an extension of `GPT2` but changes to the layering.
  
  - #### GPT-NeoX
    - For GPU, we suggest GPT-NeoX, [Repo Here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/)

  - #### GPT4All
    - What I enjoy about this software is that it is really easy to install and use, plus it requires very bare metal resources.
    - WebUI for GPT4All written in Flask (Python) by Nomic AI, [Repo Here](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all-ui)
    

- #### PyChatGPT
  - [Official Repo](https://github.com/rawandahmad698/PyChatGPT). PyChatGPT is an on-going API written in `Python` to help scale and integrate `ChatGPT` to various applications / eco-systems via TLS.
