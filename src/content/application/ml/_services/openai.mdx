### ChatGPT
  - TLDR; ChatGPT is an extension of GPT3 / GPT3.5 and focuses on holding a `natural` conversation with the `client` / `User` by keeping track of the previous question(s) / responses.

ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by OpenAI that uses a text generation language model to understand and produce natural language text. 
Furthermore, it has been trained on a massive amount of text data from the internet and can create text that resembles how humans write and speak, based on a given input.
Finally the software can answer questions, converse on a variety of topics, and generate creative writing pieces but beaware that it might provide false information.
OpenAI based the ChatGPT architecture from the sibling model, InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
ChatGPT accomplishs this by its advance machine learning engine, built using a deep learning architecture called the `Text Transformer`, which enables it to learn patterns in language and generate text that is coherent and human-like. 
ChatGPT is one of the most advanced chatbots in the world and has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and digital systems.
We will be providing examples of how to use prompt engineering to obtain positive feedback results from GPT software.
