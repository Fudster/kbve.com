## Journal

*This is a collective journal with tasks, opinions and notes.*
*They should not be taken as valid information and should be seen as mere unaudited thoughts of a wandering collection of souls.*

- ### Log
  
  - #### 4/5/2023
    - Merging the notes on prompt engineering with the mL notes because I believe they would fall into the same category.
    - I will try to update the notes more often as the field keeps progressing and changing rapidly.
    - Finally I believe we could add more videos as examples.

    - -> October 24th, 2022 -> "Computational Learning" as well as "mL/AI" -> two important concepts.
    - We should say that `ai` is an umbrella phrase that includes various tools, concepts and data. If we could imagine data as crude oil then we can say `models` are refined oils, thus the functional aspect of refinement should be a pillar of machine training.
    - It be like taking data from our `natural` world, filled with its random and chaos, is collected or drilled, then processed into abstract collections of meaningful and layered information, finally forming our computational models.
    - There definitely is more to this but that should be a solid building path for where we can go.
    - The speed at which this field is growing is also remarkable, its still insane to see how my laptop can generate art from just processing my vocals as I talk.
