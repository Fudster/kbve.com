#### Astro Icons

> [!Deprecated]
>
> This library is not an official Astro Plugin. It is a third party library that is not maintained by the Astro team.

This library makes referencing sprites/SVGs very easy and simple within Astro.
Example:

```html
<Icon name="mdi:account" />
```

`mdi` is a reference to Material Design Icons, can be swapped with any major pack, like `fa` for font awesome.
`account` is a reference to the actual file within the pack.
