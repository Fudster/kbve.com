## Design

Would you like to learn how to write JavaScript code that is clean, clear, and consistent?
Do you have a passion and desire to solve common problems in software design with ease and elegance?
How would you like to master JavaScript and dazzle your peers and clients with your brilliant code?
Did any of these questions resonate with you?
If that rings a bell, you’ve hit the jackpot by coming to this resource!
We will introduce you to the power and beauty of `design patterns` and how they can enhance and transform your work.
Design patterns are reusable solutions that help you organize your code, simplify your logic, and communicate your intent.
They are like recipes or templates that you can use to cook up delicious and nutritious code for your app.
You will learn about some of the most common and useful design patterns in JavaScript, such as creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
You will also see some real-world examples of how these patterns can make your code more efficient, maintainable, and readable.
By the end of this documentation, you will have a better understanding of design within JavaScript and how to apply it to your own projects.
And as a bonus, KBVE will also share with you some of the best resources and tools to learn more about design patterns and practice them in your own code.
So do not miss this opportunity to become a better JavaScript developer!
Read on, discover the secrets of design patterns and experience the magic and potential of design patterns for yourself below.

### Design Patterns

The theory of javascript design patterns can be classified into three major categories, namely creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
These classes differ from each other in various distinctions and aspects, such as how complex and elaborate the pattern is, the level of detail it offers to the developer and end-user, and the scope of its impact on the system being designed.
Understanding these divisions can help developers choose the most suitable design pattern for their specific needs and goals within the application, interface or project.

#### Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns enable a more adaptable and reusable code by offering a flexible framework for creating objects or classes.
In this nature, the design shields the users from the complex construction process and streamline their interaction with the classes.
Thus, the pattern controls the user-class interaction and save the developers from handling complex construction.

Factories, builders and singletons are the three core concepts of creational design pattern.

##### Abstract Factory

The `Abstract Factory` concept is a component within creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
This concept is advantageous when a system or application requires the versatility of handling diverse objects that share a thematic connection, or in other words, the system needs to work with multiple types of objects that are related by a common theme.

To exemplify, envision that a developer is working on a cross-platform application that requires generating user interface components, such as buttons, modals, forms, text boxes, and menus.
The programmer would utilize an `Abstract Factory` to define an interface for creating and rendering these UI elements.
Then, the developer could have different concrete factories that implement this interface to create UI building blocks for different platforms (e.g., Windows, Android, iOS, MacOS, Linux).
As a result, the rest of your application codebase can remain the same and doesn’t need to know the details of how the UI/UX elements are created for each platform.
Instead, the application or software can just use the factory interface to create the UI features it needs, thus optimizing productivity and resources.

##### Builder

##### Singleton

#### Structural Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns, SDP, are concerned with how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures.
They help to ensure that changes in one part of the system do not affect other parts.

#### Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral Design Patterns, BDP, define the communication between objects and how they interact with each other.
They help to ensure that objects work together in a coordinated manner.

### UXUI

Collection of design libraries and frameworks for your javascript applications.

#### MUI

Material UI, which is a library of UI components for Javascript applications that follows Googles design guidelines.

#### TailWindCSS

TailWindCSS or Tailwind is a custom open source CSS framework written in Javascript that enables utility css classes.

##### TailWindCSS Install

Since the core of TailWind is written in NodeJS, you can install it via `npm` || `yarn` || or any node package management software.

##### TailWindCSS Config

The default name for the configuration file is `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs` and the default location is within the root of the project.

##### TailWindCSS Animation

Animation Utility provides animating elements, which can be extended and abstractly layered through Rive/Lottie.

The default animations are:

`animate-spin` : Which uses a keyFrames spin to transform / rotate the object, primary use case is for loading indictions.
`animate-ping` : Uses transform to slowly scale out the element and create a radar / ripple effect upon the element, primary use case is for notifications.
`animate-pulse` : Alter the opacity of the element, to create a fading in and out effect, primary use case is for skeleton loaders.
`animate-bounce` : Transform the Y access of the element. primary use case is for aesthetics.
`hover:$animation` : Conditional statement, where if the mouse is over the element, perform the animation.

###### Spin-Slow

This is a custom animation that you can add to TailWindCSS by extending the animations field within the configuration file.

Scoped: `animation: { 'spin-slow': 'spin 5s linear infinite',  }`

Proof of Concept:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
	theme: {
		extend: {
			animation: {
				'spin-slow': 'spin 5s linear infinite',
			},
		},
	},
};
```

```

### SWUP Journal

- 11/10/2022 - There seems to be issues with SWUP and frameworks that use partial hydration. The reference of the DOM seems to be the core, thus there might be a requirement of a modular framework that sits in between certain partial content and SWUP. Based upon the research, it seems that Gia might be an approach to take.
