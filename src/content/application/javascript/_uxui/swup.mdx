### SWUP Journal

- 11/10/2022 - There seems to be issues with SWUP and frameworks that use partial hydration. The reference of the DOM seems to be the core, thus there might be a requirement of a modular framework that sits in between certain partial content and SWUP. Based upon the research, it seems that Gia might be an approach to take.
