    Lottie is a dynamic and innovative library developed by Airbnb that bridges the gap between designers and developers by allowing the incorporation of rich, high-quality animations into applications with ease.
    Built to interpret and render animations exported as JSON data from Adobe After Effects, Lottie facilitates the use of intricate animations without the overhead of traditional image or video files. With platform-specific integrations for iOS, Android, and the web, Lottie ensures that animations remain sharp and fluid across different screen resolutions and devices.
    By providing a more interactive and visually engaging user experience, Lottie has become a game-changer in the realm of modern app design and development.
