### Tailwind


##### TailWindCSS Install

Since the core of TailWind is written in NodeJS, you can install it via `npm` || `yarn` || or any node package management software.

##### TailWindCSS Config

The default name for the configuration file is `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs` and the default location is within the root of the project.

##### TailWindCSS Animation

Animation Utility provides animating elements, which can be extended and abstractly layered through Rive/Lottie.

The default animations are:

`animate-spin` : Which uses a keyFrames spin to transform / rotate the object, primary use case is for loading indictions.
`animate-ping` : Uses transform to slowly scale out the element and create a radar / ripple effect upon the element, primary use case is for notifications.
`animate-pulse` : Alter the opacity of the element, to create a fading in and out effect, primary use case is for skeleton loaders.
`animate-bounce` : Transform the Y access of the element. primary use case is for aesthetics.
`hover:$animation` : Conditional statement, where if the mouse is over the element, perform the animation.

###### Spin-Slow

This is a custom animation that you can add to TailWindCSS by extending the animations field within the configuration file.

Scoped: `animation: { 'spin-slow': 'spin 5s linear infinite',  }`

Proof of Concept:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
	theme: {
		extend: {
			animation: {
				'spin-slow': 'spin 5s linear infinite',
			},
		},
	},
};
```
