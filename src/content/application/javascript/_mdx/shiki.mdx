title: Shiki
description: |
    Shiki is a syntax highlighter based on the same syntax definitions as Visual Studio Code, ensuring accurate and visually consistent code highlighting.
    When integrated with MDX, a format that combines Markdown and JSX, Shiki can provide syntax highlighting for code blocks within MDX content.
    The combination ensures that developers get a high-quality, themeable code highlighting experience in their MDX-based documents or blogs.
