title: React Three Fiber
description: |
    React Three Fiber (R3F) is a React renderer for Three.js, a popular 3D library.
    R3F brings the power of React's declarative component structure to Three.js applications, making it easier to build and manage complex 3D scenes.
    By integrating the two, developers can leverage React's state management and component lifecycle with Three.js's 3D rendering capabilities.
