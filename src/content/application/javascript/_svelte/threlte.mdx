2. `@threlte/preprocess` - This package is the preprocessor for `@threlte/core`.
3. `@threlte/extras` - Additional components, helpers, hooks and more that extend the core functionality of Threlte.
4. `@threlte/rapier` - Rapier physics engine integration through components and hooks within Threlte.
