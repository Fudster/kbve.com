### Action

For the sake of clarity, let's consider any node that performs an action on a given service or platform as an "action plugin." The exact categorization might vary based on the way n8n continues to evolve.

These nodes perform an operation like sending an email, adding a database record, or making an HTTP request.

-  `CRUD Operations` : Most service-based nodes in n8n have Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. For instance:
   -  `Airtable` : Actions like "Append", "List", "Read", and "Update".
   -  `MongoDB` : Operations like "Insert", "Find", "Update", and "Delete".

- `Messaging Actions` : For nodes that allow sending messages or notifications.
   - `Slack` : Send message, Invite user, etc.
   - `Telegram` : Send message, Send photo, etc.

- `File Manipulation Actions` : Nodes that allow file uploads, downloads, and manipulation.
   - `FTP` : Upload, Download, Rename, etc.
   - `Google Drive` : Create, Download, List, etc.

- `Utility Actions` : Various utilities or actions that might not fit into typical CRUD operations.
   - `HTTP Request` : Make a custom HTTP request.
   - `Execute Command` : Run a custom shell command.
   - `Spreadsheet File` : Read, Write operations on spreadsheets.

- `Data Transformation & Manipulation` : Although not directly "actions" on other services, these nodes perform actions on the data within the workflow.
   - `Set` : Set or overwrite values.
   - `Move Binary Data` : Move binary data between properties.
   - `Rename` : Rename keys.

- `Flow Control Actions`:
   - `SplitInBatches` : Splits items in batches for parallel processing.
   - `Merge` : Merge multiple streams of data.
   - `NoOp` : Do nothing (used for controlling flow or debugging).

- `External Integrations`: Almost every integration with an external service will have specific actions unique to that service.
   - `GitHub` : Create issue, Get repository, etc.
   - `Twilio` : Send SMS, Make Call, etc.
   - `Shopify` : Create product, List orders, etc.
