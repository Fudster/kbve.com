Imagine you have a lot of toys that you like to play with on different websites.
Some of them are your own toys, and some of them are shared with your friends.
You do not want anyone else to take or break your toys, so you need a way to keep them safe.
Autheila is like a special friend who helps you do that.
Autheila asks you for your name and a secret code every time you want to play with your toys.
Sometimes, Autheila also asks you for another secret code that only you know or have.
This way, Autheila makes sure that it is really you and not someone else who wants to play with your toys.
Autheila also remembers your name and secret codes for all the websites, so you donâ€™t have to type them again and again.
You just have to tell Autheila once, and then you can play with any toy you want.
Autheila is like a smart and helpful friend who protects your toys and makes it easy for you to play with them.
