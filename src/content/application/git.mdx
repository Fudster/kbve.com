## Git

Everything you will need to prepare for git!

## Github

### Sweep

Sweep is an mL-powered dev bot that helps transform bug reports and feature requests into codebase changes.
To get started, we recommend looking through their [starter docs](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep#-getting-started).

### Github Notes

These are the notes for utilizing Github at an organizational level, with links/reference point to various modules/actions within the github eco-system.

### Github Labels

KBVE Default Labels are located [here](https://github.com/organizations/KBVE/settings/repository-defaults) , referenced as, `https://github.com/organizations/KBVE/settings/repository-defaults` , swap out `KBVE` with your organizational slug.

### Github Actions

Github Actions are yaml files that help automate repetitive tasks with low-level intelligence / variables.

#### Github Itch

Github Action - Itch.io Publish

- Marketplace [Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/itch-io-publish)
- Dev [Repo](https://github.com/KikimoraGames/itch-publish)

Example Github Itch Workflow:

KikimoraGames Example YAML:

```yaml
name: Itch Deploy

on: push
env:
  ITCH_USERNAME: my-itch-username
  ITCH_GAME_ID: my-itch-game-id
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Upload to Itch
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      matrix:
        channel:
          - windows
          - webgl
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy - Itch.io ${{ matrix.template }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v2.0.8
        with:
          name: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          path: build/${{ matrix.channel }}
      - uses: KikimoraGames/itch-publish@v0.0.3
        with:
          butlerApiKey: ${{secrets.BUTLER_API_KEY}}
          gameData: ./build/${{ matrix.template }}
          itchUsername: ${{env.ITCH_USERNAME}}
          itchGameId: ${{ env.ITCH_GAME_ID }}
          buildChannel: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          buildNumber: ${{ needs.version.outputs.version_hash }}

```

Remember to add your secrets, `BUTLER_API_KEY`, before deploying to Itch.
You can grab the `BUTLER_API_KEY` from Itch via [API Keys](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys) , which will allow Github Actions to communicate with Itch.io's API.

KBVE Example:

```yaml
name: Itch KBVE Deploy

on: push
env:
  ITCH_USERNAME: kbve
  ITCH_GAME_ID: my-itch-game-id
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Upload to Itch
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      matrix:
        channel:
          - windows
          - webgl
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy - Itch.io ${{ matrix.template }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v2.0.8
        with:
          name: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          path: build/${{ matrix.channel }}
      - uses: KikimoraGames/itch-publish@v0.0.3
        with:
          butlerApiKey: ${{secrets.BUTLER_API_KEY}}
          gameData: ./build/${{ matrix.template }}
          itchUsername: ${{env.ITCH_USERNAME}}
          itchGameId: ${{ env.ITCH_GAME_ID }}
          buildChannel: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          buildNumber: ${{ needs.version.outputs.version_hash }}
```

### Github Unity Test Runner

Here is the Game-CI Test Runner updated to v2.1.0, the notation/tab spacing might be off.

```yaml

- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2.1.0
    id: testRunner
    env:
        UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
    with:
        projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
        unityVersion: ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        customParameters: '-nographics'
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
        with:
            name: Test results (all modes)
            path: ${{ steps.testRunner.outputs.artifactsPath }}

```

## SubModules

These are notes and guides on how to build out submodules inside of Git, so that you can control certain plugins throughout multiple repos effortlessly. This can go into private packages later on, if we need to.

The shift to the private packages will come as we grow bigger and require more control.

### Submodule Symbolic Link

These are notes on how to symbolic link multiple directories without having to run into issues.

#### KBVE Module Example

Suppose we have already added our submodule for an Unity project, via `KBVE/UnitySubModule` and wanted to link them into our source, well this is how:

Create a folder inside of `Assets` named `Plugins` and then cd into it:

Example of the shell, do not copy and paste, make sure you read through the commands and swap out the right variables!

```shell
cd ./unityRootProject
cd ./Assets
mkdir Plugins
cd ./Plugins

```

Once inside the `Plugins` folder, we can execute the symbolic link using the `ln` command, like this:

```shell

ln -s ../../submodules/UnitySubModules/Vuplex

```
