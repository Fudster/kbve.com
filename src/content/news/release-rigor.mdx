## Release v1

This is the official news article about the release of v1, Rigor the Isolated Demands.
This release will be officially live within the end of year. 
The most recent delays have been because we switched over from a Strapi core API to an Appwrite API with cloud functions. The idea here would be keep the core logic and data within the Appwrite application but extend out everything else in 3rd party style tooling.
