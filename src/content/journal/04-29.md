## Notes

### 2023

- Pre Launch has been pushed back over and over! While it sucks to have to delay the MVP, it is great to see the backend and frontend stack evolve and become more mature. I think Astro still has a long way to go but so far I have been impressed and amazed with how fast it has grown.

> Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over.
