## Notes

- 7:00am - Most of the morning was spent looking into how I should handle svelte within this `kbve.com` repo, but I need to open up Unity and dive a bit deeper into that workflow.
I was able to clear up the invoice for Silver and we should be holding a meeting later today regarding the future of the game.

- 9:00am - Looking over the UI/UX and there are a couple things that we could improve upon, including the mini-map and general flow of information on the screen.

- 12:00pm - RJ Meeting! I will come back to this aspect and update the notes regarding this issue.

- 4:00pm - Going to try the Unity Cloud build and hopefully it will be able to build the application without any major issues.
I will have to look into how to setup the whole Unity DevOps, but from my basic understanding, it looks pretty straight forward!
We might try and have both repos active, one on Github and one of Unity cloud but it might end up becoming a bit too costly to run in the long term.
