## Notes
### 2023
- 10:32am - Lunch with the family, I know it will make me feel old because I am watching all my younger niece and nephews grow up to almost become adults, which is wild to me.
- 2:11pm - Spent the Sunday morning hanging out with the family! Now I am back on the computer and going to start the micro function migration.
- 4:45pm - The first function will be the register, which has been somewhat of an issue for a while because I have to make it create the user, profile and the various other components within the structure.
- 8:21pm - Everything is working to a certain extent, so I am glad that it is moving along! I am getting a better understanding with how Appwrite and Docker are working, its really making things a ton easier as I am getting to understand it.
- 2:00am - Halo and One Piece?! I am all into this mixture! Best combination, because its really a throw back, I remember playing halo 2 and watching one piece at the same time a decade ago.
