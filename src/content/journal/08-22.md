## Notes
### 2023
- 6:34am - My sleep schedule might be a bit off for right now but I will be working on getting it back together within this week. 
- 7:43am - Going to sync the repo with the dev branch and then start to make notes on the mL and Nodepy. To grab the appwrite key, I did a test case to see if I could read the variable. ```javascript
  router.get("/app/app/", (ctx, next) => {
  try {
    _v(`{r} -> app -? ${process.env.KBVE_API}`);
  }
  catch (error) {
    _v(error);
    ctx.body = {
      status: 500,
      message: error,
    };
  }
}); ```

- 7:44am - Let me sync the repo.
- 7:50am - There were a couple errors with the sync going to fix them up after work.
- 9:30am - The market looks like a bull trap, honestly I am hoping that the feds do another pause on the rates and keep the slow increase going. 
- 9:33am - Going to clean up some more of my notes and maybe use a bit more of the GPT.
- 5:32pm - Off of work and now I am going to see if I can push these notes through.
- 9:25pm - Added charts to the stocks but need to do some more updating and configurations! There are a couple of interesting test cases that we could pivot around and make a bit better for `meme.sh`.
- 11:16pm - I went through the RentEarth and was able to clone and repo through everything, I should make it into a template in the future but for now this seems to be more than good enough.
