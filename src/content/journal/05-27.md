## Notes

- 9:00am This was a rough Saturday morning as well, I might have to start sleeping a bit earlier because it is definitely getting a bit too late.
- 10:30am - Finally bought my cooking skill cape on `TwitchKBVE` on OSRS and started to look into certain profit makers for the account that I can do while I am afking it. ;)
- 3:00pm - The major focus for the day will be getting the CityVote scrapper to be functional under a new docker container that uses the Node-Python as a base.
- 11:00pm - I am thinking of trying a new main support because of Shaco bans, I tried Senna but she really was not my play style, so I am going to pickup Sej again! She plays a bit different from the rework, I do miss the stack of ages build on her. Back then you could have like 3-4 Rod of Ages stacked and have a ton of AP / HP / Mana over the course of the game.
