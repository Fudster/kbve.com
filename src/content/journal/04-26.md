## Notes

### 2023

- Learning GraphQL. Okay we got the basics of the AppWrite integration, i.e login, signup and user profile but there is no subscribe yet.
- The newest restaurant that I enjoyed was `Indian Spices 4U, Manjalpur, Vadodara` , and it was damn amazing. They have an all you can eat / lunch special, so starve yourself for the whole day and then binge out on amazing egg dishes. I recommend asking for boiled eggs on the side, with no salt/pepper and then dropping them crushed into the curry gravy.
