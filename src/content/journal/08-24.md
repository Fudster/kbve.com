## Notes
### 2023
- 8:40am - Nvdia's bubble is insane but also the fact that they have a margin of around almost 70% is mind blowing. 
- 9:45am - Okay we are seeing some pull back from the markets but I need to focus on some of the stuff for work, so I will keep this journal a bit small in that sense.
- 6:00pm - Finally finished up with the general work related tasks, the backup recovery is still having some issues that I need to migrate and fix but I will test case that on my own time. 
- 7:20pm - Currently making sure all my accounts are ready for the hackathon tomorrow and that includes making sure we have the basics out of the way. 
- 8:08pm - There was an issue with the Business operations aka BizOps document not rendering the graphs, so I will fix that right now.
