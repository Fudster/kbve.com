## Notes

### 2023

- 10:00am - Going to prepare myself to visit a local temple, which includes climbing a kilometer flight of stairs. The workout and stress from all that walking is definitely going to be terrible! However the views are going to be amazing and can not wait to be in the sky.
- 5:00pm - That was an intense trip, my feet are sore as hell. I am going to take a short rest and fix up some of the codebase, eat a small meal and get some rest.
