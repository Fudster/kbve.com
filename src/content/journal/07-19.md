## Notes
### 2023
- 11:41am - I am falling behind my virtual journal entries and keeping digital logs. I need to find a faster way to keep track of these, maybe split the journal md file location OR maybe keep the mac book open to keep logs on it without causing issues on my screeen.
- 12:48pm - Trying to figure out the navigation / routing for RentEarth / React. There are a couple issues that I am running into, the biggest being the ability to change the path that the user is on.
