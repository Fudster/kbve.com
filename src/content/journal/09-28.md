## Notes
### 2023
- 6:40am - So the plan for the mornings should be a sunrise photoshoot? This would be a great excuse to get outside early and improve upon my photography skills! I already have a decent collection of equipment and a ton of abstract software background, I think its just finding that niche that I want to explore within. 
- 8:30am - All I am craving is a mocha whey protein shake with an extremely spice Taylor ham and egg bagel! The combination of the heat that it generates and sweetness from the coffee, make it an amazing blend! It hits around 1000 calories but that is definitely more than enough to breeze through until mid-day. 
- 4:35pm - Almost have my Appwrite / Square hackathon project outlined, now I just need to execute it as fast as possible before the event ends. There are a couple things that I wanted to make sure that would work before I commit a ton of time into them.
- 11:15pm - Pushing through some of the work projects, I also just got another job offer and damn I am already backed up for this weekend!
