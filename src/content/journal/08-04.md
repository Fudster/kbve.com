## Notes

- 3:07pm - Going to look over the `account` mdx files and see if there are any additional templates, widgets and/or tooling needed before adding the r3f.
- 4:15pm - I was going through the `application` content folder to prepare for the tag folder and I am thinking that I might switch it up and try a complex structure. The first step would be to being the folder for the tags, which I will place under the `tags` and then under the `pages`, I will make a folder that is `t` which will be a slug-based id system? That could be one option, damn I just realized that I am tackling two different issues insides of the same patch. This would be a foul play in the management of the patch style of development, because I am jumping from one issue to another without having it referenced.
