## Notes
### 2023
- 10:21am - Using ChatGPT to just quickly write out some content is becoming an addiction and I believe it might be the real mindwoke virus xD. 
- 11:00am - Okay! For my unsplash project, I was able to secure the camera but now the issue is getting a digital frame that can render the images with a bit more pixel density. Currently the frame that I have right now has a terrible resolution and under the intense light from the sun, most of the artwork looks like pretty bad. Furthermore, I do need to test my photo skills, including how well I am at for figuring out the different lighting.
- 5:58pm - Updated some of the minor components on the main page of KBVE! I am not too big of a fan of the current layout, I might have to find another way to handle it.
