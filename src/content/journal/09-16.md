## Notes
### 2023
- 7:18pm - Finally got the docker swarm to work within my favor, there were a couple issues that I needed to resolve but for the most part it was pretty dope to see parts of the functions working. Now getting the command line to be operational will be the next step, but that might be something that I am willing to wait off on until things are a bit more stable within the eco-system at Appwrite. 
- 7:22pm - Now I need to convert over a couple of the cloud functions for the whole eco-system to the new repo and then do the deployment from there. I have to also test case the backup system and make sure that it works as intended, but that will be worth it before the hackathon.
