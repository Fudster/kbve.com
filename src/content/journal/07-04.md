## Notes

Happy Independence day yall scrubs. Please do not blow up your hands when engaging with fireworks. Do not mix BAC with fire.

### 2023
- 3:30pm - Looking over some of the issues on the main website, there are a couple locations that just do not work as intended. I suppose one of the reasons we are not getting Adsense approval is because of the deadlinks that are splattered across the whole website! 
- 3:50pm - On the sidebar, I will add a media dropdown. The dropdown will be linking to manga, gaming, music and video for now. I went ahead and made it into a Git issue, which I will close out with the next pull request.
- 8:00pm - Besides the sidebar update, I went ahead and started to update the Search a bit. I am trying to use it more personally but there are a couple things that I also wanted to address and add. One of the things that I might look into would be adding a custom search range that we can save via localStorage and have it insert in every search? This would be an interesting area to explore later down the line.
