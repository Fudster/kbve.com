## Notes

### 2023
- 7:00pm - Late start to the PC neety life, had to touch grass.
- 7:30pm - Caffeine check! Red bulls, yup. Coffee, was drank before I even got home. Water? A gallon of filtered water, hopefully there are no PFAS chillin in there. 
- 8:00pm - Going through all of the backlogs and then creating issue tickets for each one! The idea here would be to have about 50-100 issues that are pending, then focus on tackling as many of them as possible. A bit of a wave function style management per say.
