## Notes

### 2023
- 12:25am - The ending hours of a hackathon! We got a couple hours to throw the whole application online, I can feel the stress going through my veins. We were having a ton of trouble with docker and appwrite functions, rough.
- 9:59pm - The hackathon is over! I am still stressed out over all the different adventures. I ended up spending most of the day sleeping, had to catch up on the `zzz`.
