## Notes

- 12:30pm - Looks like the Indian office approved my grandpa's visa extension! This is great news as it means I can plan my new trip to India a bit better and not have to worry about him being in India with an expired visa. This makes me wonder how my life will be when I am nearly at his age of 80? He is a true warrior, the man has done it all. 
- 3:30pm - I need to start planning the construct and layout for RareIcon, with all these projects in the backlog, I may have to find a better way to manage my time within the scope of error handling? I should utilize more of the error / issues that we have and then target them each over time.  I will postpone anything major for RareIcon until we get RJ onto the Steam store.
