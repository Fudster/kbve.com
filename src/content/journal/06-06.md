## Notes

- 9:00pm - I messed up the formatting for my notes on 06-06 in the year of 2023. 
- 10:00pm - A general summary for today would be that we were able to finish up / wrap up the cloud build! It looks like Unity was able to build the game, however we still have a couple things that we need to finish up before we could release a working steam demo. One of the core concepts that I was looking into was how we could start the wishlist before throwing together the demo. I should use the word `playbale` lightly, I would say that it does run but most of the crashes are actually just minor bugs and unexpected events, per say.
- 11:00pm - The new login system has to be setup and we need to get that going within the next couple days, so that players could load into the game without having any major issues.
