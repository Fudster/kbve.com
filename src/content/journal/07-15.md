## Notes
### 2023
- 6:00am - Going through the react native code base once more. These mornings are starting to become very blurry, as I am just diving deeper and deeper into the react eco-system. 
- 7:00am - Mapping the pipeline for the iOS / Android.
- 4:00pm - `FLAG` - Need to process the written notes for 07-15-2023 into this journal entry.
