## Notes
### 2023
-  10:30am - Preparing for todays trip into the city! I will be taking a train with @bell into the capital of the capitalistic shadow realm, hopefully I do not encounter any trolls, goblins or dark entities.
- 4:30pm - Interesting set of events, we went through the train and part of the train tilts into the train station, which was extremely weird but I assume it was because they were doing construction / fortification. I am going to further assume that this is part of that infrastructure plan. 
- 4:00am - What a fucking trip, it was a bit more expensive then what I expected but I enjoyed all of it. The Halal Chicken Chopped Cheese Sandwich. That was the most legendary sandwich ever made in the past decade. It was the perfect balance of spice, protein, and flavor, I am going to forever remember it as the sandwich night.
