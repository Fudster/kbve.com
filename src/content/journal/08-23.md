## Notes

- 8:10am - I believe I got the general flow of the docker container! Yay!
- 6:51pm - Going to sync the notes in between the sessions. Okay, now I need to add github actions to the `NodePy`. so that it can build the images without having any major issues. As for the key storage, I am thinking that it would be an AES style encryption, so that there would not be any major issues. 
- 7:40pm - I added the docker image creation test casing, under the workflow.
