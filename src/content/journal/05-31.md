## Notes

### 2023

- 10:00am - Most of this day will be spent working on the Conch react script but also figuring out the basics of the cloud functions. The idea here will be to isolate as much of the script(s) that I am building and move a certain amount of the logic into cloud functions. I do also want to move certain functions into their own worker threads but that will be something that I can work on later down the line.
- 1:00pm - It looks like we can continue development of RogueJester but at a limited scale, at least until we get a better understanding of the whole project. Starting Monday, we will begin a month of active but slow development. We will be doing about 3 weeks of development currently but hopefully it is enough to get the whole game to at least beta / demo.
