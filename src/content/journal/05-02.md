## Notes

### 2023

- I spent a sold amount of time getting the hang of Flutter again. The amount of times I have seen the word widget has driven me insane.
- Morning ? Mid : Spent some time walking around a small park and finally had a `frankie` and it was okay, not as hot as I had hoped but the flavor made up for it. 
- Mid Day: Ezoic just fixed the email server issue! w00t! I can finally send emails without them going into spam xD!
- 5:15pm - I am chilling at the local library and trying to integrate a client-side database inside of Flutter. Part of me enjoys the abusive relationship because it feels great to resolve the bugs but at the same time, it slowly feeds into my Sith viewpoint of Google. They really have an amazing framework but damn, they really know how to drop the ball in certain areas. If it were not for some of the cool people that I have met through my fluffy flutter adventures, I would have definitely just jump ship and head over to react native or just skip straight to Unity.
