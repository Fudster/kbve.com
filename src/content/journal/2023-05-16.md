## Notes

- 9:00am - When I was taking my mom to her doctor's office, I noticed that they were using a full react-based eco-system! The patients would have tablets, where they would sign forms, fill out and double check their information, schedule and more!
- 12:00pm - Spent some of the time going through the Unity project. I still need to do some updates here and there with some plugins however they might break the game in other areas. I believe test casing or a system to test case the game might have to be on my agenda down the line.
- 2:00pm - Quick workout session , some minor chores, damn laundry! 
- 3:00pm - One Piece, league and programming session aka Memegramming! I am trying to rotate out of Shaco and into Senna, but getting the build and learning the play style have been some issues that I wanted to resolve. Found out that Luffy pumps his own blood to get stronger but also shortens his own life.
