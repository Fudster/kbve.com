## Notes
### 2023
- 5:45am - I had to get up early to fix up some of the issues with my roof's sun window? I am not too sure what they are called but there is a leak and honestly, the moment there is a roof leak, you know its going to be a problem down the line.
- 10:11pm - I will have to come back and update today's journal entry after the hackathon because it seems to be causing Astro to crash a bit.
