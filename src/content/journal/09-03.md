## Notes
### 2023
- 5:05am - On the PC this early? I woke up way tooo early, the sun is not even out yet and this screen is way too bright for my eyes. 
- 10:24am - Need to quickly catch up on the 3rd episode of Ahsoka, I am super excited for this mini-series and so far it has been great! It definitely has a bit of a slower vibe but I am enjoying the way they are looping the timeline and handling the world building. I should be careful not to put too much information out there as well. 
- 11:36am - A couple hours of just chilling and now I am getting ready to mount the CPU heatsink onto the tower.
