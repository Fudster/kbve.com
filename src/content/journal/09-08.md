## Notes
### 2023
- 6:03am - Currently going through the process of setting up the decentralized file storage but I am not too sure how I should go about handling the meta data engine. I am debating if I should just use the cloudflare egress or maybe switch over to another type of meta storage. 
- 11:15am - I am thinking that it might make sense to create a global redis instance that we could call from any point? There are a couple different ways that I wanted to approach this concept, one being a bit similar to how I was planning to handle the Rust+Redis build / layout. Okay so we could have two instances in this structure, one being the meta and the other just being a general redis? Hmm, I suppose one would be `meta.kbve.com`, the next being `engine.kbve.com` and finally `redis.kbve.com`? This would be the first move before building out the decentralized hybrid swarm.
