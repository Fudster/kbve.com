## Notes
### 2023
- 7:32am - Going over some work emails and getting a general vibe going to today's hackathon! It is a 24-hour Audiocraft hackathon with no major prizes but I always wanted to generate music, so I figured this would be fun regardless.
- 7:51am - Going to migrate the notes and general flow of the hackathon into just one area that we can look over and use to communicate / reference.
