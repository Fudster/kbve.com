## Notes

- 9:00am - Time to look through the backyard and do some general upkeep. The lawn looks healthy but part of me wants to start replacing certain aspects of it. One of my dream concepts would be to expand the mint garden, to the point where there is a natural aura of mint that flows through the property.
- 10:00am - I should really think about placing a quick recipe onto KBVE for my amazing mint tea. Hmm should I go with a generic tea style and then build upon it? Maybe include various ways to show it off too. 
- 6:00pm - I was a bit slacking on the note taking but there is a general flow of how I would want to improve upon that.
