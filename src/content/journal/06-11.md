## Notes

### 2023

- 11:00am - Just got ready! Going to spend some time cleaning up the backyard and doing some general cleaning. Damn my room got a bit messy, not too much trash but my clean clothes are are not organized the way that I would want. I like to take small 5-15 min. blocks where I just tackle a specific area of my room, then rotate around. I do need to do inventory of my electronics again this weekend.
- 2:30pm - Spent some time reading up on Aaron Swartz, thought I might include his open source manifesto and maybe take a couple jabs at improving it here and there. I found it to be interesting that it has been over 15 years since he released the document.
- 4:30pm - Getting ready to go to the park! I need to enjoy some of this fresh air and weather before it becomes too hot. After the park, I will take a look at the resume issue and also see if I can get started on the next stage of development within the resume tool.
