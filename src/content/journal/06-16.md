## Notes

- 8:00am - Need to change my sheets again, damn weather is wild. In the summer heat, I am thinking every week the sheets might have to be changed.
- 10:00am - I might be assigned on a couple call options for TSLA again this week! I will have to be very careful and maybe roll them out for another week, the premium of a couple hundred will be helpful to offset the RogueJester costs. 
- 1:30pm - Watching episode 8 of the Silo and doing some quick updates to the webmaster tool. I am currently thinking to just get a basic tool out there and then over time expand it to include various services.
