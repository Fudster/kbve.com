## Notes

- Spent most of the day cleaning up and preparing my luggage for the trip back to India.
- Parker sent me this open source lawn mower, [Open Mower](https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower) and it really seems like a great idea down the line to look into. Imagine launching a landscaping business where you use robots to manage all the lawn care for your clients!
- AppWrite integration test casing is probably where I will spend most of my time today on. I ran into some issues with the GraphQL and sending out verification emails. It seems that Ezoic keeps removing our SendGrid CNAME / information, thus putting our emails back into the spam folder.
