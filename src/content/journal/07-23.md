## Notes
### 2023
- 9:00am - I need a haircut but I also need hair! The density of my hairline is getting rough, I am looking at losing it all within the next couple years, womp womp. Maybe that gym grind needs to really pump up, should I do the duel daily flow? 
- 10:39am - Looking over the sweep ai and mapping out what I should be doing this Sunday Funday.
