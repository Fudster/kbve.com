## Notes
### 2023
- 10:30am - Minor updates to the current issue tickets that are open. I definitely want to integrate some of the GPT-style concepts into the issues and then get to the point where I can have it patch, pull and merge different edits to the main repo! Think of it like Sweep but a bit more geared towards content generation and general clean up.
- 4:05pm - Coffee! I require some damn coffee.
- 9:37pm - The amount of memes that this is requiring. Ugh, I am diving deep into the caffeine binge. My basement has skyrocketed in temp, its actually super scary how hot it is getting in here.
