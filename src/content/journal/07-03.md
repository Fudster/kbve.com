## Notes
### 2023
- 10:00am - Going to quickly head over to a friends house for a 4th of July party to help setup and prepare. I am about to do the classic h0ly move of bringing things, setting things up and then leaving early!
- 4:00pm - I have to split up the login form into two or three different classes or maybe have different modules? I am a bit confused on the path that I want to take for setting up the login system. This has been an issue for a bit way too long, I am thinking that I might just stick with very basic moves and then later on, go back to write it up.
