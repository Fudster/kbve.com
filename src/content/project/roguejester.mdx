## Information

We are currently testing for the Steam Demo release.

We definitely think the dark and darker style but set in the cyberpunk future is the best way to describe the path the game will take.

@h0lybyte wants to organize the notes a bit more.
The goal would be to make the notes a bit easier to read and flow.
@ziggy added Mermaid, which I believe we should use moving forward with our notes.

Updated the Project file for RogueJester

-> Previous Updates:

> > Github LFS Resolved, Using Unity Plastic SCM to handle Build Maintenance. via h0ly + Silver
> > Town Generation Work via Silver

-> Discussion Topics
-> Town +Island Scene Combination
--> proposal of town/scene combination is aligned to open-world concept
--> assets within each sub-scene would be appropriate these sections
--> Conclusion Is: Faraway sub-island with town/city assets on it will be created, and will remain to create the illusion of faraway city for the player in the Island Scene

-> Night Scene - Tutorial
--> Gives the player an opportunity to acclimate to the game and its controls.

We decided to remove almost all of the Unity MicroFPS codebase and introduced Opsive controller / inventory system.

The reason we decided to switch over is because it will speed up development and resolve some of the cosmetic / physics / animation / logic issues that we are currently facing.

I believe majority of this week will be spent on focusing on integrating both Opsive plugins into the game. Thus all of Patch 1.2.x will be towards getting everything for the player done.

So we were working on the pipeline, durning the development hell that is Unity, and ran into a "Build" success but a "Build and Run" failure.

We spent some time re-merging the base, switching branches, thinking it might be a cluster of different issues.
Silver comes in clutch and finds out that there was a `duplicate on GameManager Prefab Replacer , 2 of the same script on same object`.

- Had an issue with the basing earlier in the day. We will split the branches further, to avoid conflicts and issues when rebasing / merging branches.
- When migrating from the public to private repo, there were some issues with `secrets` and CI/CD, these issues are still open and should be resolved this week.

- Ideas How to Convert 1. System.Text.Json namespace to convert C# objects to JSON and vice-versa.
- Explained in this [link](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/articles/convert-object-to-json-in-csharp#:~:text=The.NET%205%20framework%20provides%20the%20built-in%20JsonSerializer%20class,built-in%20JsonSerializer%20class%20that%20converts%20objects%20to%20JSON)
- Thus, convert the JSON string to class object in C# using the `JsonSerializer.Deserialize () method`.
