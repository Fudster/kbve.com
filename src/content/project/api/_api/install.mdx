### API Install Introduction

In the dynamic world of software, where even a moment's downtime can make or break user trust, managing the API installation process is paramount. P
resently, our journey starts at Proxmox, winds through qEMU, and culminates in Docker Swarm.
From there, Portainer takes the baton to deploy the image.
While most of our front-end instances proudly wear the labels of applications or static pages, there are those intriguing outliers - the edge cases where we might stumble upon SSR or hybrid applications.
Let's dive deeper into this fascinating setup.


The current API installation process needs to be migrated but it currently sits as this:

- Proxmox -> qEMU -> Docker Swarm
- Portainer -> Deploy Image

With all front-end instances being either applications or static pages. 
There might be a couple edge cases where we have SSR or hybrids applications.

### v1

For v1, we would like you to look into the [Appwrite documentation](/application/appwrite/)

### v0

The following information below is for installing the older API, which was just a MariaDB cluster with Strapi.

- To help scale the API backend, we are also currently developing the backend cluster of both the API and the database that stores the information (MariaDB).
  - Current Docker Compose for ve2
