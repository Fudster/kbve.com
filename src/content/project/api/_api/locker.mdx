title: Locker
description: |
    Client-side storage allows web applications to store data directly in a user's browser, offering speed and offline accessibility.
    However, to ensure data integrity and security, locking mechanisms can be implemented, restricting unwanted or concurrent modifications.
    Think of it as a personal vault in your browser, where the combination is known only to trusted sources

### Locker Information

The locker will serve as a client-side storage for variables and data points that we do not need to `hit` the main server for!

The current locker that we are using as of August 12th, 2023 is below, but if we need to extend it out further, we shall.


### Locker Modal

```typescript

export type kbveLocker = {
	username: string,
	phone: string,
	last: string,
	uuid: string,
	avatar: string,
	github: string,
	instagram: string,
	email: string,
	theme: "dark" | "light" | "auto",

};

```

### Locker Storage

For the management of the locker storage on the client-side, we will be using [nanostores!](https://kbve.com/application/javascript#nanostores).
There is an option to extend AES encryption ontop of the stored values but that will be something that we can implement in the start of the next year.
