    Imagine an exclusive movie premiere where only the A-listers get the golden ticket.
    In our digital eco-system, APIs host such premieres, and authentication is that golden ticket, a secret handshake ensuring only the worthy gain access.
    By presenting the right credentials, software parts whisper to each other in trusted tones, creating a blockbuster performance behind the scenes.

### Auth

- Auth Journal
  - For the core of the API, we will use JWT as the `key` in between the $User and $API.
- React JSX
  - The first mod will be the core auth system between the client $User and server $API, which includes the register and login. While we build it out, we will include generic defensive components into the foundation, then re-visit and apply external security, such as limits and firewalls (some may operate outside of the API).
    - Cookie Storage (of the JWT)
      - Cookie - `token` - will store the client $User JWT.
      - Cookie - `user` - will store the client $User data.
      - Library: `react-cookie` will be used to help maintain the cookies.
