title: Authentication
description: |
    Imagine an exclusive movie premiere where only the A-listers get the golden ticket.
    In our digital eco-system, APIs host such premieres, and authentication is that golden ticket, a secret handshake ensuring only the worthy gain access.
    By presenting the right credentials, software parts whisper to each other in trusted tones, creating a blockbuster performance behind the scenes.

### Auth

- Auth Journal
  - For the core of the API, we will use JWT as the `key` in between the $User and $API.
- React JSX
  - The first mod will be the core auth system between the client $User and server $API, which includes the register and login. While we build it out, we will include generic defensive components into the foundation, then re-visit and apply external security, such as limits and firewalls (some may operate outside of the API).
    - Cookie Storage (of the JWT)
      - Cookie - `token` - will store the client $User JWT.
      - Cookie - `user` - will store the client $User data.
      - Library: `react-cookie` will be used to help maintain the cookies.

- For the Appwrite JWT, we will be holding it inside of a session store from Nanostores, at least as of right now.

### API Keys

API keys serve as unique identifiers, allowing our application to communicate seamlessly with our servers.
Rather than asking for a user's password— which can pose security risks— these keys authenticate requests by proving that the application making the request is authorized.
Think of them as special passwords generated specifically for the software, ensuring secure data exchange while keeping user credentials confidential.
By utilizing API keys, we prioritize both the user's privacy and the integrity of our platform.

#### v0

The current method of storage has a couple risks that we need to migrate, including the way the data is being encrypted within the storage of the database.
