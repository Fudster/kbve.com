### Uptime Notes

- ![API Uptime Badge](https://api.checklyhq.com/v1/badges/checks/206925a6-0f7b-4669-a4fd-b61b3f5b70fc?style=for-the-badge&theme=default&responseTime=true)

The current uptime badge is handled by ChecklyHQ, however we could build out our own uptime management software down the line.
This would be an interesting test case for the NodePy, having it automatically do test cases every hour.
I will make an issue ticket when I feel like it would be time to set this up.
