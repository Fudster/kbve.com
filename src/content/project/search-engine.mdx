## information

The search engine project or [/search/](https://kbve.com/search/) was meant to be a small but unique collection of search engines that I could easily utilize!
I am getting a bit tired of switching amoung GPT-based and data-mine based search engines, i.e going from You's GPT to Google to Bard for searching. 
So the solution that I am thinking was to create a general but search engine experience at the core and then extend it out with unique features.
The premise of this document was to keep a direct source for information related to the project that we could reference and keep up-to-date notes.

## Notes

These are the notes for the search engine project by KBVE and the community. 

### Log

- [X] Fix up CSS for the core search
- [ ] Remove and restructure the tabs + unique search components. 

#### Journal

##### 2023-05-19

We started to fix up the terrible generic Google CSS and started to overide some of the results. 

###### 2023-05-21

Minor tweaks to the mobile and general dark mode of the search engine.

### License

The license for the search project would be a bit tough because we are using several different search engines and license bases.
I believe it would be a combination of the MIT and Apache but also copyright license / releases from each of the Engine that we use?
I suppose this will have to be a future issue once we get a bit more complete and up to date.
