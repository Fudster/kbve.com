### Autonomous

### Training

### Layered

- "Layer" is related to neural networks, especially deep learning, as the concept of `layer` refers to a collection of nodes operating together at a specific depth within the network.
- Deep learning models, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can have multiple layers, which is why they're often referred to as "deep" networks.

### Agent

- "Agent" typically refers to any entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators. 
- The primary goal of an `agent` is to perform actions that maximize some notion of cumulative reward. 
- The `agent` achieves this by learning the best strategy from its experiences, often without being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task.

### System

- `System` typically refers to a combination of algorithms, data, and processes designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks based on data-driven learning.
Furthermore, a machine learning system can be broken down into several components:

- - `Data Collection` : Before training a model, relevant data must be collected. This could be images, text, sensor readings, or any other type of data.
- - `Data Preprocessing` : Once data is collected, it often needs to be cleaned, normalized, or transformed in some way to be suitable for training.
- - `Model Selection` : Based on the task at hand, a particular algorithm or type of model (e.g., neural network, decision tree, support vector machine) is chosen.
- - `Training` : This is the process where the chosen model learns patterns from the training data. 
    The model adjusts its internal parameters based on the feedback from a loss function, which indicates how well the model is performing.
- - `Validation` : During or post-training, a separate set of data (validation data) is used to tune the model and prevent overfitting.
- - `Testing` : Once the model is trained and tuned, its performance is evaluated on a test set, which consists of data it has never seen before.
- - `Deployment` : If the model performs satisfactorily on the test set, it can be deployed in a real-world setting, whether it's for predicting stock prices, diagnosing diseases, or any other application.
- - `Maintenance and Monitoring` : Once deployed, the performance of the model needs to be continuously monitored. It may require periodic retraining or fine-tuning based on new data or changing conditions.

The entire collection of these components and stages, orchestrated together to achieve a specific goal, can be referred to as a "machine learning system".
Such a system often interacts with other systems, like databases, user interfaces, or APIs, especially in production environments.
