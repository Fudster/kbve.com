### Layered

- "Layer" is related to neural networks and starts with the letter 'L'. In the context of neural networks, especially deep learning, a layer refers to a collection of nodes operating together at a specific depth within the network.
- Deep learning models, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can have multiple layers, which is why they're often referred to as "deep" networks.
