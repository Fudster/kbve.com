## Business Operations

This document will go over the basics on business operations, following this basic bullet point list below:

- Create a holding company that has nothing to do with me personally (e.g. Magic 8 Ball Holding)
- Since it is a holding company, it can only own shares
- Then make the LLC for whatever I'm trynna do, owned by the holding company
- The more nested the holding companies are, the better
- The purpose for this is to remove liability and add extra steps just in case
