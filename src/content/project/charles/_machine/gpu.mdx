    Prioritize GPUs with high CUDA core counts, substantial VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA's A100 or V100 Tensor Core GPUs), and support for hardware acceleration frameworks like NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN.
    Multi-GPU setups or GPU clusters can further boost performance, especially for large-scale training tasks

As of right now the only supplier that we can look at is Nvdia because of their CUDA core integration, thus limiting us to only a couple models:

- NVIDIA RTX 3090

- NVIDIA RTX 4090

- NVIDIA RTX 4090 TI
