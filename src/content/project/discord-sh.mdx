## Information

Discord.sh is our first KBVE service that aims to help build automated discord bots for private communities. 
I am currently testing various bots to see which would be the best as the base for us to use.

## Development

These are the short notes on the development cycle.

### Red

After some consideration, we were thinking that it would make the most sense to use Discord.red as the core of the bot.
This way we can focus on expanding the modules aka the cogs while having the perks of the open source python bot.
Execution of the bot can be done in a python-only docker image or we could wrap the bot around NodeJS using NodePy.

## User

These will be the notes on the user interface and experience.
