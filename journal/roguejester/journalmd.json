I think we should go with Option A?\\\\n\\\\nOption A: .unitypackage\\\\nDownload the .unitypackage from the Releases page on GitHub.\\\\nImport everything into your project\\\\n[Release](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases)\\\\n\\\\nSo I will grab the unitypackage and then proceed to import it.\\\\n\\\\nI wonder if I will need to apply to the Steam store to get an API key? Hmm."},{"title":"Player Updates","body":"Minor updates to the player class","slug":"https://kbve.com/journal/roguejester/_journal/patch1-2-4","tag":["rj"],"content":"\\\\nOkay so I went ahead and added a couple more things to the `GlobalValue.cs` file:\\\\n\\\\nLets start with the PlayerName, PlayerJWT and PlayerEmail\\\\n\\\\n```c#\\\\n    public static string PlayerName {\\\\n        get {   return PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"PlayerName\", \"Guest\");   }\\\\n        set {   PlayerPrefs.SetString(\"PlayerName\", value);   }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    public static string PlayerJWT {\\\\n        get {   return PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"PlayerJWT\", \"Guest\");   }\\\\n        set {   PlayerPrefs.SetString(\"PlayerJWT\", value);   }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    public static string PlayerEmail {\\\\n        get {   return PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"PlayerEmail\", \"Guest\");   }\\\\n        set {   PlayerPrefs.SetString(\"PlayerEmail\", value);   }\\\\n    }\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nSo would we call them like this?\\\\n\\\\n```c#\\\\n//1\\\\nGlobalValue.PlayerJWT.Set(\"JWTHere\");\\\\n\\\\n//2\\\\nGlobalValue.PlayerJWT = \"JWTHere\";\\\\n\\\\n//3\\\\nGlobalValue.PlayerJWT.set(\"JWTHere?\");\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow I am thinking it might be `//2` based upon what the other references to GlobalValue, so I suppose we could try.\\\\n\\\\nI will also change the `PlayerName` function to `PlayerUsername` , to keep within the naming flow.\\\\n\\\\nAlso do we need to call `PlayerPrefs.Save();`? Does GlobalValue already do that?\\\\n"},{"title":"Player","body":"Player Notes for 1.2.x","slug":"https://kbve.com/journal/roguejester/_journal/player","content":"\\\\n## Player Global Values\\\\n\\\\nOriginal as of 1.2.x\\\\n\\\\n```c#\\\\nusing System.Collections;\\\\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\\\\nusing Unity.FPS.Game;\\\\nusing UnityEngine;\\\\n\\\\npublic class GlobalValue : MonoBehaviour\\\\n{\\\\n    public static int PickPlayerID {\\\\n        get { return PlayerPrefs.GetInt(\"PickPlayerID\", 0); }\\\\n        set { PlayerPrefs.SetInt(\"PickPlayerID\", value); }\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    public static int SavedCoins\\\\n    {\\\\n        get { return PlayerPrefs.GetInt(\"Coins\", 0); }\\\\n        set\\\\n        {\\\\n            PlayerPrefs.SetInt(\"Coins\", value);\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    public static float SavedCurrentExp\\\\n    {\\\\n        get { return PlayerPrefs.GetFloat(\"CurrentEXP\", 10); }\\\\n        set\\\\n        {\\\\n            PlayerPrefs.SetFloat(\"CurrentEXP\", value);\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    public static int PlayerLevel\\\\n    {\\\\n        get { return PlayerPrefs.GetInt(\"PlayerLevel\", 1); }\\\\n        set\\\\n        {\\\\n            PlayerPrefs.SetInt(\"PlayerLevel\", value);\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n    public static float MaxHp\\\\n    {\\\\n        get { return PlayerPrefs.GetFloat(\"PlayerMaxHp\", 100); }\\\\n        set\\\\n        {\\\\n            PlayerPrefs.SetFloat(\"PlayerMaxHp\", value);\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nI am thinking we can add these to the PlayerPrefs\\\\n\\\\n```c#\\\\n\\\\n    public static string PlayerName {\\\\n        get {   return PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"PlayerName\", \"Guest\");   }\\\\n        set {   PlayerPrefs.SetString(\"PlayerName\", value);   }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nCan you do nested functions?\\\\n\\\\n```c#\\\\n\\\\n    public static string _pN {\\\\n        get { return PlayerName(); }\\\\n        set { PlayerName(); }\\\\n    }\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nI will test case these tonight, when I get a chance to mess around with after the main branch builds.\\\\n"},{"title":"Error within the Prefab","body":"Oh this was another pain.","slug":"https://kbve.com/journal/roguejester/_journal/error_prefab","content":"\\\\n## Error inside the GameManager\\\\n\\\\nSo we were working on the pipeline, durning the development hell that is Unity, and ran into a \"Build\" success but a \"Build and Run\" failure.\\\\nWe spent some time re-merging the base, switching branches, thinking it might be a cluster of different issues.\\\\nSilver comes in clutch and finds out that there was a `duplicate on GameManager Prefab Replacer , 2 of the same script on same object`.\\\\n"},{"title":"J6","body":"Migration to Private Repo","slug":"https://kbve.com/journal/roguejester/_journal/6","content":"\\\\n## J6\\\\n\\\\n  - Had an issue with the basing earlier in the day.
