I asked a fellow friend to bring me some Goldbond lotion from America, which my grandparents love and its a bit hard to find here in India. \n- 11:15am - Looking over the `kbve.com` repo and noticed that there needs to be some updates that I have to do for the day. \n- 11:25am - Quick break from travel / coding and going to relax, watch some game trailers and sip some coffee. The Unreal 5 game engine demos have been crazy! I can not wait to test out Unreal when I get back into the states, I will not be diving too deep into that engine, as I am still learning how to master Unity. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Trust your hunches.
