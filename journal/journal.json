So I pay around 1000R and get a \"full body\" checkup, from almost every major medical branch. It was a bit time consuming, about less than 2 hours in total but it was definitely better than having to schedule a bunch of different doctors. Furthermore, since they all work in the same hospital, they could give secondary reviews and be able to cross-pin among different areas of a concern. I will try to make a quick reference about this for anyone that might want to do medical tourism within Gujarat, India.\n\n- After the hopsital trip, I did a casual photo shoot at Sonia Studio and it was magical. First time experiencing the depth that a photographer goes to get the best shot of a person, besides just the angles, lights and timing. Will I ever want to do modeling again in the future? Nah. Was it fun? Yup and for many other reasons as well.\n\n- Now its about 1pm and I decided to meet up with a local and chill at his work. He basically runs a safety & maintainece company for a buddy of his\n\n## Quote\n\n> Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction.\n> — <cite>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [X] Finish yearly medical check.\n- [X] Check prices on electric tuk tuk / rickshaws / ricksha.\n- [ ] Scope out local tailor for pants.\n- [ ] Ant Spray for the house in India.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Tuesday : 2023-04-18","description":"Daily Log for 2023-04-18","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1679597454485-d1d04f88b78a?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-04-19.md","slug":"2023-04-19","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- Visiting the inner city this morning and it was wild! The food smells amazing but the crowd is mind numbing and the traffic is insane, damn I almost got hit by a tuk tuk / rickshaw at least 3 times. \n- Currently trying to fix the issues with SendGrid and Ezoic. It seems that Ezoic's DNS is replacing the SendGrid CNAME by dropping it. When trying to place the CNAME inside of the Ezoic DNS panel, it seems to say that it can not proxy it. I rasied a community ticket on their forum, hopefully they can get it resolved but if they can not then we might use a 3rd party domain. \n- Upgrading Coolify to v3.12.31. Before upgrading, I am going to execute an AWX backup stack. This is another test case for a full scale backup, including the SQL database but excluding snapshots.\n- Integration of Portainer and Coolify still has some issues, including volume and network management.

If I wanted to render the assets charts, I should just be able to reference a component for the types of charts and get back what I need, rendered and compressed. We can start with simple charts and then expand them with more style, options and information. Starting with chart0 being the most basic and then we re-do/re-build as we move up from chart1 to chart9, ect...\n\nI guess the question would be how far we would want to expand the charts at the static level and then when should we start to integrate dynamic data endpoints to the charts. I believe that should be handled after we get the backtraced charts out of the way.\n\n## J3\n\n- Stripping out the extra information, such as option contract data, forward PE, RSI, ect...\n- Short hand titles might be a future issue as we scale out from 100 assets to 1000, 10000, 100K\n- International stocks also have additional tags that might cause duplication, I think the best move would be to modify them manually until we can get a better system in place?\n\n## J2\n\n- h0lybyte: I was able to pull 100 assets, format them into json. However, I was running into an issue when turning the json list of assets into MD files.\n- h0lybyte: In the n8n pipeline, the charts / img data gets stripped out.\n\n## J1\n\n- h0lybyte: Open Issue [#88](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.com/issues/88)\n  - We will expand the amount of stock assets to around 100 and then do some data mining / data parsing for the 100~ assets as a test case. We might also expand a bit of the crypto. I was thinking it might be best to do a couple initially by hand, to see how we can build out & map out the total automation process , which will include fetching / updating.\n  - Basic pipeline would look like this: `n8n -> function_asset -> fx{var: ticker} -> .json -> .md -> gist`\n","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Asset Dev Log","description":"Dev Log for Asset Page of KBVE!","tags":["asset"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1610993302487-6dbfc0acf4ed?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}},{"id":"visualnovel.mdx","slug":"visualnovel","body":"\n\n## J2\n\nh0lybyte: Okay we got the pipeline operational, even unicorned Github a couple times but it looks like it should be smooth sailing for the time being.
