Vite is throwing some errors here and there within the rollUp, so I am currently in the process of debugging that. Afterwards, I aim to integrate AppWrite into Svelte, so that it can execute a bit faster than the current React setup. While React is able to get the basics done, there is a bit of a delay between each action, around ~600ms because it has to communicate with the API (from AppWrites end), I am trying to see if I can resolve that , or at least make it less noticeable via the UX/UI end. One of the aspects I was thinking of was to store the user information locally after login, to have an almost instant load WHILE only having `update` and `delete` require a connection/load.\n- `Something went wrong installing the \"sharp\" module` - Sometimes I hate the sharp module with a passion, I am going to wipe the local installation clean and start fresh from the dev branch. \n- Next issue was that Search via the MDX page was throwing some weird errors and honestly I am a bit too tired to figure out why it was giving a pain. I am assuming its because I forgot something to render or messed up the JSX / react syntax, but to make it easier, I decided to migrate it out of the MDX concept and make it its own .astro page. While I wanted to make it all uniformed via MDX template, certain areas might not be worth the time. Furthermore, I disabled the bing / you searches because they were giving errors of CORS on certain browsers.\n- I would say this is a bit of a major update to the website, as I begin to migrate + add more into the framework.\n- Under search, I expanded the options and included `reddit.com` and `stackoverflow.com`. The results are not within the iframe but instead they open in new a window/tab; I will gladly add more options/parameters down the line, including expanding into images and GPT/LLVM.\n- 8:37pm - It seems that my idea of having a general namespace and then running a custom templating system out of that is just a bit too much. I will go with a more simple widget style and just import the widgets directly, instead of having them all over the place. I just get confused and there just so many options and ways to do things... that it just too much. Sometimes I over-engineer everything and it might not be the best, BUT it was dope to have emoji-style templating, even if it was a complete waste of time, rip 50+ hours I spent lmfao.

There were no major database migrations but I backed up everything to be safe. \n- Next mission is to upgrade AppWrite from 1.3.1 to 1.3.3 , which I am doing right now. There are some issues that I need to address between the AW and Strapi API, including the unique keys/index.

This is to help improve performance and to clean up the workspace, so that others can easily navigate through and not have any issues. There are instances where certain files get referenced twice, once via the Namespace and then again directly via import. \n- I have to restructure the name convention and I believe that keeping it extremely basic will be better in the long term. Thus I think it would make sense to use the term, `Widget` , and place all the `Element` / `Action` into that area and the migrate them out again in v2 of KBVE.com. Mapping out each widget seems to be a waste of time right now, as I keep rotating different file names and file types without keeping something straight forward.\n- Another interesting error that I am having is with the email(s) going into spam. The issue is actually not on my end but rather that our advertisement platform, \"Ezoic\", throwing errors ecause it is unable to proxy the CNAME from our email provider, \"SendGrid\".

I will have to transfer them over to this knowledge bank later this week. There are two core pillars that I have to make sure that I get right for deploying future iOS applications. The first will be getting flutter to actually build and sign the application, so for that I will run `flutter doctor -v` and see what it requires for the iOS / iPhone build. It seems that I will need xCode and CocaPods, it was pretty straight forward for getting the xCode, as I was able to grab it from app store.\n- The CocaPods aka a Swift package manager that Flutter uses for iOS development was easy to install, just had to run `sudo gem install cocoapods` and then agree to the xCode license.\n- The next pillar is the development and pipeline, currently I am able to build the iOS application within the development eco-system. However I will have to figure out how to setup the CI/CD for the application, ideally making it so that once the commit is made on the `main` branch, it will automatically deploy the application to the Apple App store.\n- 3:00pm - Going to prepare to pack up my luggage! It seems that my grandparents have some older suitcases, so I am thinking of letting them have mine, while I go grab some new ones. I am going to travel to either the `CromAs` or `InOrbit` mall and pickup two new suitcases. The total cost was around 15000 Rupees and they were pretty solid hardshell cases, they look and feel like a CSGO crate haha.\n- \n\n## Quote\n\n> If you want your life to be more rewarding, you have to change the way you think.\n> — <cite>Oprah Winfrey</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Install and update xCode / CocoPods.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Thursday : 2023-05-04","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-04","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1661948746536-14df44b0ad43?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-05.md","slug":"2023-05-05","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 9:30am - Woke up a bit earlier today, got ready and headed out to the border part of Vadodara, known as Gotri. I asked a fellow friend to bring me some Goldbond lotion from America, which my grandparents love and its a bit hard to find here in India. \n- 11:15am - Looking over the `kbve.com` repo and noticed that there needs to be some updates that I have to do for the day. \n- 11:25am - Quick break from travel / coding and going to relax, watch some game trailers and sip some coffee. The Unreal 5 game engine demos have been crazy! I can not wait to test out Unreal when I get back into the states, I will not be diving too deep into that engine, as I am still learning how to master Unity. \n- 12:30pm - I am looking over the CI/CD for the Android deployment. Its been a couple years since I messed around with this, I remember doing it before in Jenkins and again in Gitlab, so I am sure it will be even easier with Github / Git Actions. Later down the line, I will look into doing hybrid deployments, including a combination of private and public repos, to avoid any future issues of licensing / conflict of interests. (i.e if I am using a paid Flutter theme and want to include it inside an open source project! We would host the paid theme inside a private repo and let the open source project pull the code during the build / deploy phase.) Here is an interesting article that goes over what I am looking to [setup](https://dev.to/matijanovosel/deploying-flutter-applications-to-google-play-using-github-actions-j8a).\n- For the releasing, I am going to use the actions from this developer, [Subosito Actions](https://github.com/subosito/flutter-action) , and the two specific ones that I am interested in are the `android` and the `ios`. \n- 2:15pm - I really hate the breaking changes in Flutter! Okay to grab the parameters from the path, you have to call `state.pathParameters['pathId'];` with pathId being the variable that you pass through. In our situation we will only be passing one pathId through-out most of the application. The user-information will be stored inside of the HiveDB for now and I will have it make the net request after pulling the information from HiveDB. So in the case of looking up the stock asset, it will check the local instance of the asset and if it does not find it, then it will make a net request for the updated json from the static kbve.com api. I am thinking if there is no internet, then have the application perform the best it can using the local storage data. Side note, the local storage for the mobile applications will be in their default documents folder or downloads folder.\n- 6:00pm - Okay I am going to remove the deep nest and keep everything at max depth of 1, so that I can streamline everything else into a simple and easy flow. So instead of `asset/stock`, it will be just `stock` or `crypto`. This will be with all content and mainly so that I can keep everything type-safe and organized later down the line without having too many constraints and dead code to deal with. There might be some SEO/SEM impact from the link structure change, but I think its safe to do it right now rather than later down the line. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Trust your hunches.

I am excited but I might also decline because the amount of pay is not worth the amount of work that they might demand. We shall see, I usually enjoy working for startups but seeing how they conduct their interviews and testing has been very off-putting. I might also not get the job because I did decline to sign any NDAs until I felt more confident with the company.\n- 9:00pm - Going to start to integrate Rive into the Flutter application!

Granted this was a shower thought but it would be interesting to develop an AI-based mentor / digital character that would reward for completing certain tasks on time? This could be combined with different pre-built personality language models, so you could have your pet digital monster become aggressive and berate you for not doing pushups? I am just writing my thoughts, hoping that I do not forget them later down the line. The idea is not have a companion that drains your mental health, but rather let you customize it based on your own personal motivational factor(s). I might not find a devil daemon calling me a fat slob for skipping 10 pushups haha but I would not want to impose that onto a younger child, if it were a gamified application.\n- 10:30am - Traveling to the local temple for the last time before I head back to the states, I actually enjoy coming here in the morning because some of the stray dogs come in and its cute to watch them engage with the locals, including them getting treats for being awesome. \n- 12:30pm - Sync the notes. It looks like the pass tool is currently broken, so I am going to try and figure out what I can do to fix it again. I believe the issue might be the way that I am handling the javascript within AstroJS, I will go through some guess and checks and see if I could resolve it that way. It works in `dev` mode but after the SSG, the `generate()` function seems to be missing or broken, so lets see what the issue could be.\n- Error @ 12:30pm: \n  ```javascript\n  (index):166 Uncaught ReferenceError: generate is not defined\n    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick \n```\n- Going to try and push the pipe through `alpha` and then test case it via the Netlify build. Okay, looks like that resolved that issue. I was missing the `is:inline` when calling the 3rd party external scripts, okay going to move back to updating the AppWrite.\n- 1:15pm - Updated AppWrite to 1.3.4, then did a quick database migration! I am wondering if there might be a way to do an update without taking the whole API down but I noticed that it could cause corrupted shards, so I suppose it might be best to keep it the way it is right now. \n- 2:45pm - Getting ready to go shopping around a local mall district. I got over 30kg worth of free space in my luggage, so lets see if I can find anything interesting to buy. Before I head out, I think I will test case some of the local pipelines that I been building, including one that is known as `cook-ai`, which is a small mL model that helps you make amazing recipes! \n- 4:00pm - Looking over all my blueprints that I have written for KBVE and starting to parse through them and organize them into something a bit more meaningful and structured. \n- 5:45pm - Great background video, [The Micro Education Business Model - How To Monetize Your Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgAMayF-JZY)!

It is always interesting to be drugged up by a dentist and then open a bunch of unix terminals to setup a virtual machine. I enjoyed being in the dentist chair, half baked, typing away linux commands. If this was in the US, I am pretty sure the dentist would have violated several ethical boundaries for what I was doing haha.\n- 12:30pm - Going to look over the current backend setup and see what needs to be updated. Overall the system looks healthy with no massive errors in any area. The main operating systems are still up to date, I looked over the unattended update logs and everything seems fine on that end. \n- 5:00pm - Looking at tiles for remodeling the home and bathroom in India! It was interesting to see that electronic upgrades are more costly than doing general service to the house. I suppose it makes sense because labor costs in India are extremely cheap, as there is a large pool of workers. Yet the tech market within India is extremely inflated and it comes mainly from the excessive tariffs that are imposed on imports. \n- 7:00pm - I think its time for me start researching into VCs/Venture again, just going to do some core / basic data gathering. I realized that I could add up to a million contacts onto the HubSpot CRM, so I am going to go through my older emails and reach out to some VC funds and build up an initial cold list. There are two main issues within the VC field that I am seeing, the first is the insane amount of capital going into machine learning / A.I-based startups and the second issue is that the rising interest rates is squeezing and limiting the general funds that they are willing to risk / invest. In addition to the rising rates, the recent bank collapses have also decreased the amount of risk that funds are willing to take.\n- 7:30pm - Going to start a developer environment with a new hybrid cloud setup. I was looking at some of the recent changes with vCluster and I think its right about the best time to do a couple edge test cases from scratch. There will be two phases for this, the first will be doing everything manually and keeping track of the scripts, configurations, ect.. and the second phase will be to use Ansible-Tower to automate the deployment of the whole setup. I do not expect any of this to be successful but I am down to see where I hit failure, last time it was with the storage.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.\n> — <cite>Winston Churchill</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Finalize materials for the house.\n- [x] Migrate rupees from bank balance to fix deposits.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Monday : 2023-05-08","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-08","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1664202526602-08cbc96c4b3c?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-09.md","slug":"2023-05-09","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 10:00am - Just had 500mL of cold brewed coffee that was aged in whisky and rum barrels! It might have been a bit too much caffeine to start the day, I feel like my heart trying to escape my body. Besides the overload of energy, the taste was amazing, the hints of whisky and rum notes are noticeable through initial taste and near the end. It blends so well that the exiting bitterness that comes with normal brews is almost gone! Overall it was nice to meet the creators of the brew, however they are still in the experimental stage and have not yet done any social / digital work. I was kindly given some concentrated powder to take back to the US with me, think of it like instant coffee? They said they would reach out if they need any digital work done, but I know that my costs might be too high for them.   \n- 12:30pm - Weighing out both bags, it looks like I have about 20kg of free space, thus I am going to go H.A.M and buy a bunch of shawls and then maybe use the remaining left over weight to grab rare spices that are a bit tough to find in the US.\n- 2:30pm - Went shopping to grab shawls and ended up going to the shop owner's home, we had tea and he talked about his past and how his kids have all moved to the UK/Canada. How I went from buying items at his shop to some how going to his home was probably the weirdest adventure lmao. I needed around 15 shawls and the type that he had in his store were the lighter material, which makes sense because its the warmer season here in India. He told me his winter stock is currently in storage at his home, so we decided it would better if I head over there and look through his inventory. When I got to his home, I was amazed with the amount of stock that he had, the dude could run his own department store from his house! His wife and her family have been hand making some of the styles but lately its been hard for them to stay afloat because of the market has been flooded with cheaper and machine made scarves. I ended up buying a couple hundred dollars worth from him, he was super excited because I basically gave him a couple weeks worth of business in less than two hours. When I am back in the states, I will try to take some cool pictures with them!\n- 5:00pm - Going to take a break from the heat and relax at a new local cafe, man there are a ton of them here, almost every street has a new cafe popping up with their own twists to coffee and tea. This makes sense because the population density is high and there are no major companies that control the sector, i.e think more mom & pop cafe shops and less Starbucks / DD.\n- 6:00pm - Researching on ways to improve the page load of KBVE.com and looking at why some aspects of the website seem to score so low. I might have to remove some of the bulk images that are being loading from UnSplash and remove some of the extra javascript code that we are not using. \n- 6:30pm - Okay it looks like our spell book seems to be causing a painful first page load. I am thinking that might be worth removing the splash component and then seeing how the site performs. The splash is cool but it might not be worth it in the long term, as it might be annoying and a bit of a waste to then scroll down. Speaking of which, I do need to start thinking about how I will handle the content that should be displayed on the front page. We could also remove some of the wait listing and shrink the footer to be more compressed and clean. Overall the changes could easily decrease the total size of KBVE by 10%, across the board.\n\n## Quote\n\n> It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.\n> — <cite>Confucius</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Tuesday : 2023-05-09","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-09","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1682684112265-e2aa4de8ddc8?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-10.md","slug":"2023-05-10","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 10:00am - SSS - *Shiitake, Shower and shave* and out the door! My last official day in India and its giving me the feels. I am going to miss this place for the time being, the society, the flow and the memories. I suppose I will not miss the random cow dung, monkeys throwing dung and the historic slums but the light and darkness create a vibrant eco-system that I can only define as karma. \n- 12:00pm - Going through the general updates for the website, I can not seem to get a basic or static result from the pagespeed tests, they keep throwing me into a random loop of scores. Sometimes I am hitting high 90s and then several sessions later, I am hitting low 60s? I can not tell if its Google or Ezoic (which is displaying Google ads?) or Cloudflare or something that I messed up within my UI/UX. The best course of action might be to just disable everything and then slowly add back content that helps with the flow. Okay lets remove the splash and the general advertisement above the fold! Maybe that might help with the flow of the website and the content. \n- 1:00pm - I removed the splash page, the floating buttons and added aria-labels to the footer buttons. I am going to go through the code base for the main page again and see if I can remove anything else that I will not need for the time being. I will have to update the Oracle component as well and have all the images load at an extremely lazy method, as they are taking a bunch of resources and data up that we do not need to offer. I suppose we could just remove all of the background images for the specific listing and place more gradient style backgrounds with slow loading images upon the hover? We could also swap the idea of a light/dark mode with a slim and heavy mode? Where the website loads with a simple bases and then if they press the heavy, it then takes them to the app. The concept we are going for might be to keep the astro layout as simple and fast as possible! With the visual aesthetics and heavy performance inside of the flutter application. \n- 1:30pm - Upgrading Astro to 2.4.4, Appwrite's Pink library to 0.0.6 RC-12. and the Astro sitemap to 1.3.1. While I am able to upgrade the components and the general website, the cache for the website does not seem to update. I will have to create a new action within Github to clear the Ezoic cache. I could have the cache get cleared via n8n or through AppWrite but I feel like having it done via Github actions would make the most sense. The idea being that we want to put the least amount of stress on our own private systems and offload as much and as many tasks to 3rd party tools and/or applications. The trade off is worth it in the long term, as we expand our collection of websites, we can make sure that the scaling will not hold back our system.\n- 2:00pm - I am trying the cache system again from Ezoic and it seems to be a bit more annoying than I remember. Furthermore, I am having a bit of a tough time clearing the cache, so I will have to look further into how they are handling it. Upon doing some more deep diving, it looks like there might be a conflict with Cloudflare's cache settings and those by Ezoic. We could have a situation where there is a double cache going on, which might make it a bit more painful for the website to be a bit more `live`, as updates might take upwards of 48 hours to dispatch. One solution would be to have some of the more active pages be limited in the cache to just under one hour? Maybe even disable all cache for news and the front page? If we put back up the chat and forum, we could also look into disabling that? These are some thoughts I will go over while I walk around the city before departing. The good news is that there are no issues within flutter, which makes sense because its just a monolithic javascript file aka dart.js that loads everything.  \n- 2:30pm - A great read on how [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/blog/the-service-powering-unsplashs-beautiful-imagery/) handles their backend stack! I love how they organized themselves into a small but productive team, something that I think a lot of startups should take note of. You do not need a massive team to get the job done, just a strong and core collective with simple mission and structure. Granted the initial look at their infrastructure map might seem a bit perplexing but its really simple at the heart. You have an extremely large data set of images and then make it fast enough for the whole world through caching and optimization. I like their take on the newer technological stacks and honestly sometimes it just might not be worth the energy at the time. Why switch your whole database from Postgres to some random new database to only save 10% of speed while breaking all your tools!? It would make more sense to focus the time on growing your business and then going back to re-tool down the line or outsourcing it to battle-proven operations.\n- Ah! Got a new amazing... high, ugh low?... score of 58 on PageSpeed! I guess it might be time to ask the Ezoic team what the fish is going on.\n- 6:00pm - We were able to figure it out! It was a Google advertisement issue that caused multiple issues then stack on top of each other. Actually it was worse but we wont throw them under the bus, because they will never care and honestly its just a shitty and sand thing overall. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Silence is the sleep that nourishes wisdom.\n> — <cite>Francis Bacon</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Get onto a plane.\n- [ ] Tom Hanking around the Terminal.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Wednesday : 2023-05-10","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-10","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1682553064442-272b63b5a541?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-10T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-15.md","slug":"2023-05-15","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 10:00am - Ah!

This means that I will have to go back and go through the codebase to see where I made the mistake. I believe that I might have hardcoded the timezone change, rather than making it a function.

It seems that I have not opened the application in such a long time that the whole vault crashes during the cache period. The solution to the problem was to create a secondary vault, next close the broken cache* vault, then delete the broken cache* vault and finally create a new vault from the location of the broken cache*. I am not too sure if this is a common bug to address, but if it happens again then I guess I will have to make a tutorial about it.\n- 5:00pm - Going through the `Manga` notes right now and there are some issues that I already see on rendering them within Flutter and Astro. Going forward I might have to combine the md and mdx files, however it feels so backwards to do so.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them.\n> — <cite>Albert Einstein</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Sync Obsidian on Windows with the Github Vault.\n- [x] Improve the UX/UI on the MDX files that are being rendered by Astro.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Monday : 2023-05-15","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-15","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1681511854055-edcb84a3e21d?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-15T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-16.md","slug":"2023-05-16","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 9:00am - When I was taking my mom to her doctor's office, I noticed that they were using a full react-based eco-system!

I am trying to rotate out of Shaco and into Senna, but getting the build and learning the play style have been some issues that I wanted to resolve.

Damn I have to stop being lazy, maybe for fun, I should make a GPS based alarm clock? The only way to turn off the alarm clock is by going to a specific GPS location. So instead of a snooze button, it would be the GPS location that would turn it off. This was a shower thought but I think it would be an interesting concept to build out.\n- 11:00am - I been holding off too long for my Twitch stream, I think it might be interesting to bring it back up? Granted there will not be any viewers but it would great to record some of the games, specifically the gameplay, and maybe develop software that could parse through the data and grab unique clips? This could be extended out to other areas later down the line as well. Too bad that I am trash at league or the the content would have been great to watch haha.\n- 12:45pm - Traveling to eye doctor and comparing it to the doctors office yesterday, this office is super old school. They keep all their records in files and take a rather long time to process their patients. From what I noticed, they could hire an extra person that would slowly transfer over their records to a hybrid-cloud, one where the data is stored locally and within 3rd party data warehouses. The time it took to get from patient to queue was around 15 to 20 mins, including the double checking of the records, insurance, forms, ect.. this could easily be scaled down to <5 mins. \n- 1:15pm - I should start to create more issue tickets regarding what areas that I need to focus on, this way I am not all over the place. After going through all the issue tickets, I will get back into programming and then head over to the mall. \n- 1:30pm - Oh I had another idea for the GPS based application, I could sync it with a map style, so that I could sync with others that might want to go to the gym or to the park. The other side of this would be to make it easier to automate the sync of activities, like going for a hike or going onto an adventure?!\n- 2:00pm - The search on the main page was broken, going to go ahead and address that really quick.

I added a new habit of asking `Bard` how I felt about it and seeing what it tells me!\n  > Bard : **Jet Lag and the Aging Brain**\n  > \n  > I hate jet lag. It makes me feel like I'm in a constant state of fog. I can't seem to focus, I'm always tired, and I'm just generally irritable. I've been dealing with jet lag for a few weeks now, and I'm starting to think that it's not just the time change that's making me feel this way. I think it's also my brain.\n  > \n  > As we age, our brains naturally slow down. This can make it more difficult to focus and concentrate, and it can also make us more susceptible to sleep disturbances. Jet lag can exacerbate these problems, making it even harder to get a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed.\n  > \n  > In addition to the cognitive effects of jet lag, it can also have a negative impact on our mood. When we're sleep-deprived, we're more likely to experience irritability, anxiety, and depression. These symptoms can be even more pronounced in older adults, who are already more likely to experience mood disorders.\n  > \n  > If you're struggling with jet lag, there are a few things you can do to ease the symptoms. First, try to adjust your sleep schedule gradually. This means going to bed and waking up a little bit earlier each day until you're back on your regular schedule. You can also try using light therapy to help regulate your circadian rhythm. Light therapy involves exposing yourself to bright light in the morning and avoiding bright light in the evening.\n  > \n  > If you're still having trouble sleeping, there are a few over-the-counter medications that can help. Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep, and it's available in most drugstores. You can also try taking a warm bath or shower before bed, as this can help relax your muscles and make it easier to fall asleep.\n  > \n  > If you're experiencing severe jet lag or mood disturbances, it's important to talk to your doctor. They may be able to prescribe medication or recommend other treatment options.\n  > Jet lag is a common problem, but it doesn't have to ruin your vacation or business trip. By following these tips, you can minimize the symptoms and get back to feeling your best as soon as possible.\n- 11:00am - Good to see $SPY go back up towards the $415+ mark, this means I can sell off at least 100 shares that were assigned to me.

I am super excited to see all the dope mods that will be coming out for the game! I will start with Ryujinx first because its on `choco` already and it makes it so much easier to setup and install. I will try and write out a guide, with the help of Bard and Bing? They tend to make things a bit easier, I suppose. Lets ask Bard for help! Yay!\n  I will create the notes as ryujinx.mdx under applications. [KBVE Ryujinx docs](https://kbve.com/application/ryujinx/)\n- 4:30pm - Going to the local mall with the mom duke, hopefully she finds something worth wild to buy. I am going there to see how bad inflation gets and to take a nice walk around. \n- 7:30pm - Holy mushrooms, the mall looks so dead and vacant! Everything is overpriced or really expensive, like the meals are insanely over priced. My normal Starbucks coffee was also way over priced and the amount of calories that I consumed, I understand what it feels like to be an American again. \n- 7:45pm - Time to break down the tasks and see what I should aim to finish up today? I am thinking it might be great to finish up the React-based API project that I was eyeing for a while to wrap up. Oh I got Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom up and running! It looks great on the laptop, but sadly I do not have a mapped out controller to play the game right now.\n## Quote\n\n> When the world is so complicated, the simple gift of friendship is within all of our hands.\n> — <cite>Maria Shriver</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Setup Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Thursday : 2023-05-18","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-18","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684316524257-83c9bfce0077?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-19.md","slug":"2023-05-19","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 9:00am - Woke up to a great day for a non-rebecca Friday! Going to clean up the car and do some generic house work for most of the day.\n- 11:00am - Going to do a deep dive into the `MINA Protocol` and see what the hype is around it. In between the research, I will look further into the CSS for the search on KBVE. \n- 4:00pm - Okay, I will break down the search into two areas with the first being the generic CSS flow and the 2nd being the additional variables that help us switch between `Dark` and `Light` mode through TailWindCSS. We were able to override the default CSS that google provided using the `@important` in our `gsc-control.css` but we were not able to extend it out into the advertisement area of the Google search results because those adverts are rendered through an `iframe`. Furthermore, we were able to use the `var(--color-primary)` and a couple other variables as a replacement for some of the key CSS classes. By using the variables, we can then use the light/dark mode feature to switch the theme without having too much of an issue. The initial route we were going to take was to just find hex colors that would suit both themes, but this ended up being the better result. \n- 7:00pm - Now for the `MINA` aspect, I am still looking through all their source / codebase but I found their ability to keep the blockchain at 22KB to be brilliant but I still did not understand how they were able to do so. I get the concept but the core fundamentals are a bit tricky for me right now, I might need to print it out, hike onto a mountain, puff some snoop and read through it all within the calmness of nature. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Whenever you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\n> — <cite>Arthur Conan Doyle</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Fix the CSS for Search","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Friday : 2023-05-19","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-19","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1683782852452-a97468c83617?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-19T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-20.md","slug":"2023-05-20","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 8:00am - I am slowly getting back into the flow of the EST time zone!

The World of Warcraft private server is really great for just taking a solid break and getting into that fantasy brain rot of smashing buttons and eating elves lmfao!\n- 5:00pm - About to head out to car shop for my father because his SUV is about to reach its end of life. It is a bit weird to look at ICE vehicles after operating a Tesla for a couple years but he needs to move cargo around all day and does not feel comfortable yet with an electric mode of transport. I was really hoping that a 500 mile Tesla cyber truck at $40K would be on the market by 2023, but it seems that might be too far away from reality and his car is definitely going to die off before we get a chance to get him that. Our current strategy is find a mid-size SUV that is pre-owned within the past 2-3 years and has a solid history. The main car in our scope is the Acura RDX from 2020-2021 and decided to test drive one of them today. The car is smooth but the kick is a bit slow for me, I am too spoiled with my adult go-kart to even think about going back to this style of driving. \n- 7:00pm - Time to refractor and start the register widget. I am going to go through the repos and servers, doing some general security updates and backups. It looks like my ansible scripts are doing a great job at keeping a rotating cluster of SQL databases, including storing the backups in multiple locations. However the `MongoDB` area is a bit rough, it looks like the backups might have failed, so I guess I will have to spend some time fixing those up tonight. \n- 9:00pm - Going to read up on the patch notes for the new Astro version.\n- 10:00pm - Updating to Astro v2.5.1 and a couple other packages as well for the main website. It looks like most of the updates will not impact our website and the local build was a success, so I will go ahead and push everything all the way up to main. While I am doing that, going to throw up some quick WoW and maybe a league match in a bit?
