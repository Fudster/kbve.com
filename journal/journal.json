Vite is throwing some errors here and there within the rollUp, so I am currently in the process of debugging that. Afterwards, I aim to integrate AppWrite into Svelte, so that it can execute a bit faster than the current React setup. While React is able to get the basics done, there is a bit of a delay between each action, around ~600ms because it has to communicate with the API (from AppWrites end), I am trying to see if I can resolve that , or at least make it less noticeable via the UX/UI end. One of the aspects I was thinking of was to store the user information locally after login, to have an almost instant load WHILE only having `update` and `delete` require a connection/load.\n- `Something went wrong installing the \"sharp\" module` - Sometimes I hate the sharp module with a passion, I am going to wipe the local installation clean and start fresh from the dev branch. \n- Next issue was that Search via the MDX page was throwing some weird errors and honestly I am a bit too tired to figure out why it was giving a pain. I am assuming its because I forgot something to render or messed up the JSX / react syntax, but to make it easier, I decided to migrate it out of the MDX concept and make it its own .astro page. While I wanted to make it all uniformed via MDX template, certain areas might not be worth the time. Furthermore, I disabled the bing / you searches because they were giving errors of CORS on certain browsers.\n- I would say this is a bit of a major update to the website, as I begin to migrate + add more into the framework.\n- Under search, I expanded the options and included `reddit.com` and `stackoverflow.com`. The results are not within the iframe but instead they open in new a window/tab; I will gladly add more options/parameters down the line, including expanding into images and GPT/LLVM.\n- 8:37pm - It seems that my idea of having a general namespace and then running a custom templating system out of that is just a bit too much. I will go with a more simple widget style and just import the widgets directly, instead of having them all over the place. I just get confused and there just so many options and ways to do things... that it just too much. Sometimes I over-engineer everything and it might not be the best, BUT it was dope to have emoji-style templating, even if it was a complete waste of time, rip 50+ hours I spent lmfao.I did learn and gain so much knowledge from the experience, so it might not have been a total waste.\n- 8:40pm - Just saw a dude on a bike get nailed by a tuk tuk / rickshaw, he was okay but was driving in the wrong direction and going a bit too fast.

There were no major database migrations but I backed up everything to be safe. \n- Next mission is to upgrade AppWrite from 1.3.1 to 1.3.3 , which I am doing right now. There are some issues that I need to address between the AW and Strapi API, including the unique keys/index.

This is to help improve performance and to clean up the workspace, so that others can easily navigate through and not have any issues. There are instances where certain files get referenced twice, once via the Namespace and then again directly via import. \n- I have to restructure the name convention and I believe that keeping it extremely basic will be better in the long term. Thus I think it would make sense to use the term, `Widget` , and place all the `Element` / `Action` into that area and the migrate them out again in v2 of KBVE.com. Mapping out each widget seems to be a waste of time right now, as I keep rotating different file names and file types without keeping something straight forward.\n- Another interesting error that I am having is with the email(s) going into spam. The issue is actually not on my end but rather that our advertisement platform, \"Ezoic\", throwing errors ecause it is unable to proxy the CNAME from our email provider, \"SendGrid\".

I will have to transfer them over to this knowledge bank later this week. There are two core pillars that I have to make sure that I get right for deploying future iOS applications. The first will be getting flutter to actually build and sign the application, so for that I will run `flutter doctor -v` and see what it requires for the iOS / iPhone build. It seems that I will need xCode and CocaPods, it was pretty straight forward for getting the xCode, as I was able to grab it from app store.\n- The CocaPods aka a Swift package manager that Flutter uses for iOS development was easy to install, just had to run `sudo gem install cocoapods` and then agree to the xCode license.\n- The next pillar is the development and pipeline, currently I am able to build the iOS application within the development eco-system. However I will have to figure out how to setup the CI/CD for the application, ideally making it so that once the commit is made on the `main` branch, it will automatically deploy the application to the Apple App store.\n- 3:00pm - Going to prepare to pack up my luggage! It seems that my grandparents have some older suitcases, so I am thinking of letting them have mine, while I go grab some new ones. I am going to travel to either the `CromAs` or `InOrbit` mall and pickup two new suitcases. The total cost was around 15000 Rupees and they were pretty solid hardshell cases, they look and feel like a CSGO crate haha.\n- \n\n## Quote\n\n> If you want your life to be more rewarding, you have to change the way you think.\n> — <cite>Oprah Winfrey</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Install and update xCode / CocoPods.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Daily Thursday : 2023-05-04","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-04","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1661948746536-14df44b0ad43?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"2023-05-05.md","slug":"2023-05-05","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 9:30am - Woke up a bit earlier today, got ready and headed out to the border part of Vadodara, known as Gotri. I asked a fellow friend to bring me some Goldbond lotion from America, which my grandparents love and its a bit hard to find here in India. \n- 11:15am - Looking over the `kbve.com` repo and noticed that there needs to be some updates that I have to do for the day. \n- 11:25am - Quick break from travel / coding and going to relax, watch some game trailers and sip some coffee. The Unreal 5 game engine demos have been crazy! I can not wait to test out Unreal when I get back into the states, I will not be diving too deep into that engine, as I am still learning how to master Unity. \n- 12:30pm - I am looking over the CI/CD for the Android deployment. Its been a couple years since I messed around with this, I remember doing it before in Jenkins and again in Gitlab, so I am sure it will be even easier with Github / Git Actions. Later down the line, I will look into doing hybrid deployments, including a combination of private and public repos, to avoid any future issues of licensing / conflict of interests. (i.e if I am using a paid Flutter theme and want to include it inside an open source project! We would host the paid theme inside a private repo and let the open source project pull the code during the build / deploy phase.) Here is an interesting article that goes over what I am looking to [setup](https://dev.to/matijanovosel/deploying-flutter-applications-to-google-play-using-github-actions-j8a).\n- For the releasing, I am going to use the actions from this developer, [Subosito Actions](https://github.com/subosito/flutter-action) , and the two specific ones that I am interested in are the `android` and the `ios`. \n- 2:15pm - I really hate the breaking changes in Flutter! Okay to grab the parameters from the path, you have to call `state.pathParameters['pathId'];` with pathId being the variable that you pass through. In our situation we will only be passing one pathId through-out most of the application. The user-information will be stored inside of the HiveDB for now and I will have it make the net request after pulling the information from HiveDB. So in the case of looking up the stock asset, it will check the local instance of the asset and if it does not find it, then it will make a net request for the updated json from the static kbve.com api. I am thinking if there is no internet, then have the application perform the best it can using the local storage data. Side note, the local storage for the mobile applications will be in their default documents folder or downloads folder.\n- 6:00pm - Okay I am going to remove the deep nest and keep everything at max depth of 1, so that I can streamline everything else into a simple and easy flow. So instead of `asset/stock`, it will be just `stock` or `crypto`. This will be with all content and mainly so that I can keep everything type-safe and organized later down the line without having too many constraints and dead code to deal with. There might be some SEO/SEM impact from the link structure change, but I think its safe to do it right now rather than later down the line. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Trust your hunches.

If I wanted to render the assets charts, I should just be able to reference a component for the types of charts and get back what I need, rendered and compressed. We can start with simple charts and then expand them with more style, options and information. Starting with chart0 being the most basic and then we re-do/re-build as we move up from chart1 to chart9, ect...\n\nI guess the question would be how far we would want to expand the charts at the static level and then when should we start to integrate dynamic data endpoints to the charts. I believe that should be handled after we get the backtraced charts out of the way.\n\n## J3\n\n- Stripping out the extra information, such as option contract data, forward PE, RSI, ect...\n- Short hand titles might be a future issue as we scale out from 100 assets to 1000, 10000, 100K\n- International stocks also have additional tags that might cause duplication, I think the best move would be to modify them manually until we can get a better system in place?\n\n## J2\n\n- h0lybyte: I was able to pull 100 assets, format them into json. However, I was running into an issue when turning the json list of assets into MD files.\n- h0lybyte: In the n8n pipeline, the charts / img data gets stripped out.\n\n## J1\n\n- h0lybyte: Open Issue [#88](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.com/issues/88)\n  - We will expand the amount of stock assets to around 100 and then do some data mining / data parsing for the 100~ assets as a test case. We might also expand a bit of the crypto. I was thinking it might be best to do a couple initially by hand, to see how we can build out & map out the total automation process , which will include fetching / updating.\n  - Basic pipeline would look like this: `n8n -> function_asset -> fx{var: ticker} -> .json -> .md -> gist`\n","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Asset Dev Log","description":"Dev Log for Asset Page of KBVE!","tags":["asset"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1610993302487-6dbfc0acf4ed?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}},{"id":"visualnovel.mdx","slug":"visualnovel","body":"\n\n## J2\n\nh0lybyte: Okay we got the pipeline operational, even unicorned Github a couple times but it looks like it should be smooth sailing for the time being.
