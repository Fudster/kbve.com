So I pay around 1000R and get a \"full body\" checkup, from almost every major medical branch. It was a bit time consuming, about less than 2 hours in total but it was definitely better than having to schedule a bunch of different doctors. Furthermore, since they all work in the same hospital, they could give secondary reviews and be able to cross-pin among different areas of a concern. I will try to make a quick reference about this for anyone that might want to do medical tourism within Gujarat, India.\n\n- After the hopsital trip, I did a casual photo shoot at Sonia Studio and it was magical. First time experiencing the depth that a photographer goes to get the best shot of a person, besides just the angles, lights and timing. Will I ever want to do modeling again in the future? Nah. Was it fun? Yup and for many other reasons as well.\n\n- Now its about 1pm and I decided to meet up with a local and chill at his work.

It seems that Ezoic's DNS is replacing the SendGrid CNAME by dropping it. When trying to place the CNAME inside of the Ezoic DNS panel, it seems to say that it can not proxy it.

I definitely will miss this place, the internal clock is already ticking. The next time I am around India, I might make plans to visit the Himalayas and also expand around Asia, definitely need to put Japan on the list.\n- I am currently debating how I should setup the AppWrite Register. I am thinking I will do the classical way first and then maybe create a widget, `react-appwrite-widget` , to handle the Register? Hmm. \n- I decided to stick with a simple register / login / account flow for now but will expand it later on once I find more usage for it. The three are under tasks.\n- Expanding the user profile via its own astro component, I have to be careful not to hit the API too much while building out the basics. We could store the basic user information into another nanoStore, so we do not have to pull from the API all the time.

If I wanted to render the assets charts, I should just be able to reference a component for the types of charts and get back what I need, rendered and compressed. We can start with simple charts and then expand them with more style, options and information. Starting with chart0 being the most basic and then we re-do/re-build as we move up from chart1 to chart9, ect...\n\nI guess the question would be how far we would want to expand the charts at the static level and then when should we start to integrate dynamic data endpoints to the charts.
